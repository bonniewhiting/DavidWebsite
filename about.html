        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>

          Trouble Will Save You, a collection of three novellas published in 2023, dramatizes the lives of three different women living in interior Alaska. As with much of David Nikki's fiction, the novellas concern themselves with issues of identity and imagination--the way narrative and mythology create the self.

        <h3>Teaching Philosophy and Practice</h3>
        <p>
          As a teacher of writing, it is my responsibility to combine the
          instruction of craft with the exploration of the fundamental questions
          at the heart of a liberal arts education—questions that explore what
          it means to be human. Although the image of the isolated artist is a
          strong one in our culture, I believe that writing can and should
          connect us to the larger world, and that it is the job of the writing
          workshop to assist an apprentice writer in complicating and
          solidifying these connections. I do this in my instruction through the
          teaching of a wide variety of authors—Toni Morrison, Yasanuri
          Kawabata, James Baldwin, Don Delillo—but also through rigorous
          adherence to a process-centered approach that treats students as
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius insisted that to become world citizens we must not
          simply amass knowledge. We must also amass within ourselves the
          capacity for sympathetic imagination that will enable us to comprehend
          the motives and choices of people different from ourselves. The
          practice of fiction writing within a liberal arts education is
          especially good at nurturing this kind of imagination because it is,
          by its very nature, an art form that should promote flexibility of
          thought. A work of fiction has the ability to situate us in the mind
          of another person, a character who might superficially be unlike us,
          and in so doing, it should blur the line between what we see as self
          and what we see as other. The writer and conservationist Rick Bass
          puts it well when he says, “Art is an engagement of the senses; arts
          sharpens the acuity with which emotions, and the other senses, are
          felt or imagined. Good fiction breathes possibility, which is to say
          that it also breathes a kind of diversity.”
        </p>
        <p>
          A process-centered approach that emphasizes feedback and revision can
          be a powerful tool to develop not only polished stories, but students
          with sympathetic imaginations. For this process to work to its fullest
          capacity, classroom discourse has to be democratic, and each student
          must be encouraged to offer their own unique perspective to the group.
          In reacting to a discussion that reflects a plurality of opinions and
          backgrounds, the writer is put in a position where they must utilize
          important critical thinking skills. They must question and clarify
          their own aesthetic sense, as well as judge and assimilate a variety
          of approaches to their work and the work of others. Ultimately this
          process should hone each writer's unique voice and empower him or her
          to write outside of a structured college environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is my role as a teacher to shape these discussions in a manner that
          walks a fine line: open discourse should never be sacrificed for easy
          clarity, and confusion should never result from openness. It's
          important that I be a strong presence in the discussion, but I see
          myself as much as a guide as a teacher. In the best workshops, when
          students are comfortable with the process, I can present the issues
          and then step back and watch the conversation move in different
          directions, pushing it here, nudging it there. In my Introduction to
          Fiction course, for example, I often critique two student stories in
          one hour and a half session; the amount of time given to the
          conversation allows for real depth of discussion. Connections can be
          made to other works the class has read that semester and various
          possibilities can be introduced and then discarded or adopted,
          depending on the value the class sees in them. We can discuss
          characters not only as collections of words and motivations, but also
          as ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I profoundly enjoy teaching and I am consistently impressed by the
          quality of work I see from young writers. Some criticism has been
          leveled against the “workshop method” as producing finely polished,
          generic art—vacuous stories with every 'T' crossed—but I would have to
          disagree. My students consistently produce work that is unique and
          interesting. I feel that there is something important at stake in
          expressing one's individuality, and in creating fictional people that
          evoke strong emotions. If we can feel sympathy for a fictional
          character—if we can understand them through a story—then does this
          allow us to understand neighbors, strangers, and so on? I think it
          does, and this gives my teaching a sense of urgency that renews itself
          each semester.

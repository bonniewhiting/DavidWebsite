            >The Bleak and the Beautiful: With Boston and its suburbs as
            backdrop, David Crouse pulls light from darkness</strong

          <p>Boston Phoenix, November 2006</p>
        </div>
        <p>By Nina MacLaughlin</p>
        <p>
          A winter walk with a part-time prostitute on Salisbury Beach. A
          confrontation with a homeless man on Boylston Street. A never-ending
          party with aging burnouts inside a tattered old Victorian in Lawrence.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Crouse excels at placing his readers within the “serene suburban
          quiet” that makes it “feel like something horrible [is] going to
          happen.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In his debut short-story collection, Copy Cats (University of Georgia
          Press), the 38-year-old native of Haverhill presents stark stories in
          which the bleak and the beautiful are tethered by tender, tenuous
          strings - all within the outskirts of Boston.
        </p>
        <p>
          “People are where they live,” says Crouse, who teaches writing at New
          Hampshire's Chester College of New England. “The places where we live
          make us who we are…. You have a foundational place in your life, a
          place where you have key experiences. You keep going back there. I'm
          going to write about this place for the rest of my life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The collection of seven stories and one novella - which won a 2005
          Flannery O' Connor Award for short fiction - effectively walks a
          tightrope between dark and light, the bleak and the bright.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's Office Space absurdity in “Code,” an ink-black comedy about a
          man in the midst of a wave of layoffs. Humor is balanced by Crouse's
          portrait of a man in crisis. Stuck in a traffic jam - symbol of
          rat-race entrapment - the narrator exits his car, climbs over the
          guard rail, and wanders into the woods, stripping naked as he goes.
          It's a moment of supreme liberation - beauty in the bleak - but it's
          also a moment in which a man becomes unhinged. Crouse is gifted at
          crafting scenes that resonate in multiple ways. In the worlds he
          creates, nothing is black and white.
        </p>
        <p>
          In “Kopy Kats,” Anthony works at a Kinko's-type copy shop in Boston
          with co-workers - “talentless alcoholic musicians and stutter-voiced
          painters wearing untucked, stretched-out concert T-shirts” - who
          “dribbled down and collected at the store in clusters of bitterness
          and unfocused fairytale ambition.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When a homeless man bangs his head in the store and is rushed away in
          an ambulance, Anthony goes on a quest to find him. On his way, he
          considers heading to Brigham and Women's hospital and his pal in X-ray
          who sells speed after hours. He thinks of stopping at Mystery Train
          Records, and of his pothead girlfriend and her “gonzo fanzine-reading
          buddies in Allston.” He ends up in the hospital room of a stranger,
          and comes no closer to figuring out who he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music filters into many of the stories - Agnostic Front, Cannonball
          Adderly, Black Sabbath. “It's tied up with that quest for identity,”
          says Crouse. “Younger people especially use music as an emblem of who
          they are…. If there's anything that unites the characters, it's that
          they have this vague sense of their own identity. A lot of times
          they're sort of searching for some sort of costume to wear. Their
          sense of their own selves is so amorphous that it causes huge
          problems.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In “Morte Infinita,” the literal costumes - it's Halloween - both
          illuminate and further muddle the characters. Thirteen-year-old
          Kristen and her troubled dad fumble through an angry time by teaming
          up together watching horror-movie marathons and trick-or-treating. The
          father's diminished sense of self translates into an inability to
          communicate with his daughter: “Her dad was talking about death and
          divorce and the depressing sound canned tomato soup makes as you plop
          it into the pan. 'It's the little things that will bring you down,' he
          said. 'Happiness requires a certain - I don't know - indistinctness of
          vision….' That was the way he spoke to her, as if she were forty years
          old and four years old.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After that Halloween with her father, Kristen comes to realize that
          there are two types of people in the world: zombies, which make up
          most of the population, and vampires. Zombies, it's implied, have that
          certain indistinctness of vision. Both are monstrous. Both are
          marginal.<br />
          “All of the characters,” says Crouse, “exist on the margins. And some
          of them are looking for something genuine but all they're finding is
          other layers of façade.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novella “Click,” for example, unemployed photographer Jonathan
          starts a project shooting a sometimes-prostitute named Stephanie. He
          accumulates image after image of her, yet it's unclear whether the
          pictures reveal or obscure identity, both his and hers. “He was making
          her life more real. Or not,” Crouse writes. “Maybe it was just the
          reverse - that with each photograph of her he was the one becoming
          more substantial.” The project inevitably becomes more complicated as
          Jonathan questions whether he and Stephanie share more than he and his
          fiancée.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the sound of metal on bone, Crouse's stories are in many ways
          “too close to real.” But it's for that reason, for the chilling truths
          and the dark revelations, that the reader can recognize the light
          hidden beneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There's this interesting feeling that I get - maybe you get it, too -
          sometimes listening to music, like a Leonard Cohen song, or reading a
          dark story. You have this feeling of exhilaration. And I think it
          comes from a feeling of recognition, a feeling that, 'ahh, this person
          is noticing this thing,' and the act of noticing it and reporting it
          is beautiful.”

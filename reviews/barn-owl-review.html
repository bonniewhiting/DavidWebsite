            <strong>The Man Back There and Other Stories</strong>
            <p>David Crouse</p>
        </div>
        <p>In the introduction to David Crouse's The Man Back There and Other Stories (winner of the 2007 Mary McCarthy
            Prize), judge Mary Gaitskill writes, “I chose these stories because they made me feel.? However, given the
            depravity and loneliness, and the penchant toward violence and criminal behavior in Crouse's work, it seems
            an odd, almost obtuse, observation, kind of like saying you picked your prom dress simply because it looked
            so bad on everyone else who tried it on, and not because it's such a beautiful match with your figure or
            made from some fabulous material. Of course, that's a flawed simile, especially once Gaitskill clarifies her
            opening remark: “By 'feel' I don't mean that I felt a particular emotion, I mean that the outcome of every
            story here mattered to me. I felt the characters like I would feel a stranger in a room or on a bus with me,
            that is, with an irrational sympathy more animal than moral in its nature.” In other words, the characters'
            pervading depravity and loneliness only makes them all the more human and exactly like the rest of us. A
            remarkable gathering of short fiction, the nine stories of David Crouse?s second collection don't just add
            to his literary resume: They go a long way toward defining it.</p>
        <p>The dilemmas Crouse's protagonists face, while episodic in nature, are often the culmination of a larger
            series of events spanning a measure of years. “The Castle on the Hill” tells us about Barry, an essentially
            lonely animal control officer. The story begins with an image recently burned in Barry's brain: “They had
            been playing with sticks-sword fighting, thrusting, dodging, and hacking.” The image of two kids at play as
            they walk down the street while Barry motors past on his way to work is something Barry can't shake because
            he may have been the last person to see these two kids alive before they were found murdered. Their bodies
            were discovered at the aforementioned castle, a sight favored by drug addicts looking for a place to shoot
            up. The castle is metaphor for many things, and one of them is Barry's inability to heal in the wake of his
            separation and divorce from Sheila two years earlier. And, once he's told about the murdered boys by a
            co-worker, Barry can't help but think of his own children, now grown, and decides to confront Sheila at the
            house he used to live in. After all, it?s only Thanksgiving dinner. Why not? But he has no idea what lies at
            the heart of his confrontation, or why exactly things fell apart in his marriage, let alone why he goes to
            Sheila's. He knows his children won't be anywhere near there, and the trip will hardly appease his
            irrational anxieties about their safety. An almost ambivalent confrontation occurs when Barry barges in and
            sits down to eat, and, inevitably, Barry tries to apologize to Sheila for some of the things he had said
            years ago, insisting he wasn't himself when he said them: “Maybe that's why he had come here…to be forgiven,
            because what was what he had done compared to what had happened today up on the hill?” But that's only just
            another stab at the answer, and not the answer itself, and you realize that pretty soon Barry's the one who
            needs to forgive himself, if he ever wants to move on with his life.</p>
        <p>Despite his simplicity in diction and word choice, Crouse is not a literary descendent of Ray Carver. The
            tone is bleak, not comic, slick more than anything else, and often stunningly quiet in the face of grave
            circumstance. The substance of Crouse's diction is often the struggle of human beings trying to understand
            their own emotions. No story attempts to engage this theme more than “What We Own,” which offers a snapshot
            of family dysfunction. Here Crouse uses narrative suspense, the slow pacing by which we learn of each
            character's dilemmas, to mirror the unspoken fragility of a family of four. On the surface, it's obvious
            that two brothers have problems: The older brother, Scott, has been sent home from boot camp after six
            months away, and the younger brother, Tim, has taken to a life of small crime in the interim. The parents,
            who seem nurturing at first, are just as problematic, especially in their preference to ignore the boys'
            behavior, not to mention the issues of their own marriage. Instead the parents attempt to make sure their
            sons are constantly fed, and their problems downplayed. When the two brothers are asked by their father to
            run an errand one evening before dinner, Tim surprises Scott by taking him to a stranger's house, which Tim
            decides to break into. Scott isn't so much paralyzed or stunned than he is dangerously curious of his
            younger brother's capabilities. Scott, in fact, is the story's narrator: “The truth was, I admitted, I
            didn't know what was happening, and I wanted to find out more than I wanted to stop it.” Of course, you know
            what's going to happen. The brothers end up in jail, and the father has to bail them out, debating whether
            or not to tell his wife what's occurred. What's more, the event has long-term implications for their family
            as a whole. But, before they're caught, Tim reflects on the nature of his crimes to Scott: “…he looked
            around the room with contempt. 'I mean, what is all this? I don?t care about things. Nobody owns anything
            anyway, not really.'” Tim is partly right, but Crouse intends this statement ironically. The least of the
            brothers' problems is the objects of other people. In fact, their struggle to take ownership of their lives
            is what's at stake because of their inability to understand themselves. And in the end, that's a perfect
            summary of the characters of The Man Back There and Other Stories, and the very reason why it's a book that
            shouldn't be ignored.</p>

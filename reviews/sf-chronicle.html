        <h2>Review of The Man Back There in The San Francisco Chronicle</h2>
        <div>

          <strong>The Man Back There and Other Stories</strong>
          <p>By David Crouse</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          David Crouse's stories are like tide pools, miniature worlds of wonder
          that we can study or admire but that are less steady and more fragile
          than their oceanic equivalents. The care and attentiveness with which
          he renders characters and their situations are moving, but there is
          always the lingering danger of the tides - the necessary, constant
          fear of being remade or revised.
        </p>
        <p>
          In “The Man Back There,” his second collection of stories, Crouse
          offers nine new specimens from his tidal worlds, including a
          44-year-old twice-divorced man fighting with his girlfriend and her
          ex, a 92-year-old senator at the end of his career, and a young man
          discharged from the Army for trying to kill himself after basic
          training. Mostly men, and almost all pitiable in some way, Crouse's
          cast of characters might elsewhere be labeled misfits or failures, but
          under his gaze they are only men between the tides, people at risk of
          being dried up by circumstance or flooded by change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear is the force that moves the tides in Crouse's world. Anxiety and
          uncertainty create a sinister terror in each of the nine stories. When
          Barry, the divorced dogcatcher of “The Castle on the Hill,” wants to
          warn his ex-wife of “the simple fact there was danger in the world,”
          his warning might seem an empty portent were it not for the
          double-murder victims he saw the morning before their deaths. And when
          Denny, the support technician for a video game company in “The
          Forgotten Kingdom,” haunts his ex-girlfriend Caroline's house after
          work “specifically to hurt her, to make her feel a small fragment of
          what his mother must have been feeling,” the effect might be more
          benign were it not that his mother is bedridden and dying.
        </p>
        <p>
          The danger in these stories is real, if only because the characters
          are convinced of it. Silence and conversation, company or solitude are
          equally terrifying for Crouse's characters in their alienation. In one
          of the collection's best stories, “The Observable Universe,” Peter, a
          man suffering from mental illness, drags his older sister Gwen, a
          multimedia artist, to a science fiction convention, where they study
          the other convention-goers and try to understand escapism, disguises
          and fictional worlds. The biologist whose gaze is usually confined to
          the small, shallow tide pools finally looks back onto the wider,
          deeper ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The troubled Peter “saw danger in the eyes of strangers on the street”
          and marvels at how “humor became horror if you let it spin around in
          your head too much.” Watching, rewinding and watching again the video
          Gwen made of his breakdown and collapse at one of the convention
          events, Peter considers the tape a version of his own death. “Was this
          knowledge,” he asks of the images: “the gasping for breath and the
          flutter of the eyes as they twitched open”? The delicacy of this
          trembling terror, in the experiences of a mentally ill sci-fi fanatic,
          scorned and burned lovers, and frustrated office employees, is most
          striking because it never stagnates. The quotidian fears of failure,
          loneliness and suffering are conveyed with great seriousness and
          engaging sincerity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take, for instance, Crouse's careful, almost tedious precision in
          coining adjectives. A woman in “The Castle on the Hill” offers a
          “you-have-the-wrong-apartment expression” when met by Barry in his
          animal-control uniform, a boy imitates his brother's “I'm-too-funny
          Buddha voice” in “Show & Tell,” and the mother in “What We Own” refers
          to her husband derisively as “Mr. Cut-the-lawn-twice-a-week.” Not
          wanting to let the description settle, Crouse is diligent in his
          construction of sometimes-too-precise phrases. His style becomes like
          its subjects: hesitant and tentative, damaged and delicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Stories, like people, are fragile things,” decides the discharged,
          despairing soldier in “What We Own.” And that decision could be a
          manifesto for Crouse's work. His first collection of stories, “Copy
          Cats,” won the Flannery O'Connor Award, while “The Man Back There” was
          awarded the Mary McCarthy Prize. It is hard to know what O'Connor
          might have thought of this writer's work, though McCarthy would
          probably have sneered at his pedestrian characters and laughed a
          little at their predictable plights. But Crouse's stories have a
          contemporary charm to them: His characters, their fears and the
          alienating anxiety of his fiction are all common, and even familiar.

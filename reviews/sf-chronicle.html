            <strong>The Man Back There and Other Stories</strong>
            <p>By David Crouse</p>
        </div>
        <p>David Crouse's stories are like tide pools, miniature worlds of wonder that we can study or admire but that
            are less steady and more fragile than their oceanic equivalents. The care and attentiveness with which he
            renders characters and their situations are moving, but there is always the lingering danger of the tides -
            the necessary, constant fear of being remade or revised.</p>
        <p>In “The Man Back There,” his second collection of stories, Crouse offers nine new specimens from his tidal
            worlds, including a 44-year-old twice-divorced man fighting with his girlfriend and her ex, a 92-year-old
            senator at the end of his career, and a young man discharged from the Army for trying to kill himself after
            basic training. Mostly men, and almost all pitiable in some way, Crouse's cast of characters might elsewhere
            be labeled misfits or failures, but under his gaze they are only men between the tides, people at risk of
            being dried up by circumstance or flooded by change.</p>
        <p>Fear is the force that moves the tides in Crouse's world. Anxiety and uncertainty create a sinister terror in
            each of the nine stories. When Barry, the divorced dogcatcher of “The Castle on the Hill,” wants to warn his
            ex-wife of “the simple fact there was danger in the world,” his warning might seem an empty portent were it
            not for the double-murder victims he saw the morning before their deaths. And when Denny, the support
            technician for a video game company in “The Forgotten Kingdom,” haunts his ex-girlfriend Caroline's house
            after work “specifically to hurt her, to make her feel a small fragment of what his mother must have been
            feeling,” the effect might be more benign were it not that his mother is bedridden and dying.</p>
        <p>The danger in these stories is real, if only because the characters are convinced of it. Silence and
            conversation, company or solitude are equally terrifying for Crouse's characters in their alienation. In one
            of the collection's best stories, “The Observable Universe,” Peter, a man suffering from mental illness,
            drags his older sister Gwen, a multimedia artist, to a science fiction convention, where they study the
            other convention-goers and try to understand escapism, disguises and fictional worlds. The biologist whose
            gaze is usually confined to the small, shallow tide pools finally looks back onto the wider, deeper ocean.
        </p>
        <p>The troubled Peter “saw danger in the eyes of strangers on the street” and marvels at how “humor became
            horror if you let it spin around in your head too much.” Watching, rewinding and watching again the video
            Gwen made of his breakdown and collapse at one of the convention events, Peter considers the tape a version
            of his own death. “Was this knowledge,” he asks of the images: “the gasping for breath and the flutter of
            the eyes as they twitched open”? The delicacy of this trembling terror, in the experiences of a mentally ill
            sci-fi fanatic, scorned and burned lovers, and frustrated office employees, is most striking because it
            never stagnates. The quotidian fears of failure, loneliness and suffering are conveyed with great
            seriousness and engaging sincerity.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, Crouse's careful, almost tedious precision in coining adjectives. A woman in “The Castle
            on the Hill” offers a “you-have-the-wrong-apartment expression” when met by Barry in his animal-control
            uniform, a boy imitates his brother's “I'm-too-funny Buddha voice” in “Show & Tell,” and the mother in “What
            We Own” refers to her husband derisively as “Mr. Cut-the-lawn-twice-a-week.” Not wanting to let the
            description settle, Crouse is diligent in his construction of sometimes-too-precise phrases. His style
            becomes like its subjects: hesitant and tentative, damaged and delicate.</p>
        <p>“Stories, like people, are fragile things,” decides the discharged, despairing soldier in “What We Own.” And
            that decision could be a manifesto for Crouse's work.
            His first collection of stories, “Copy Cats,” won the Flannery O'Connor Award, while “The Man Back There”
            was awarded the Mary McCarthy Prize. It is hard to know what O'Connor might have thought of this writer's
            work, though McCarthy would probably have sneered at his pedestrian characters and laughed a little at their
            predictable plights. But Crouse's stories have a contemporary charm to them: His characters, their fears and
            the alienating anxiety of his fiction are all common, and even familiar.</p>

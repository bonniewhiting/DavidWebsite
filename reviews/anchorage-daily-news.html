          Book review: Two sets of stories from a former Alaskan explore
          northern life and questions of identity
        </h2>
        <p>By Nancy Lord | Published in the Anchorage Daily News</p>
        <p>October 28, 2023</p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The publication of two books in one year is either an impressive
          achievement or a fluke of timing. Whichever the case may be, David
          Nikki Crouse’s short and shorter fictions are overdue and very welcome
          additions to contemporary literature. Set primarily in the Fairbanks
          area, these two books present modern-day Alaska and Alaskans in all
          the beauty, despair, and complexity they — and readers — deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crouse formerly lived in Fairbanks, receiving an MFA writing degree
          from the University of Fairbanks in 1996 and teaching there. The
          author of two previous, award-winning short fiction collections,
          Crouse currently directs the creative writing program at the
          University of Washington in Seattle, where their biography states,
          “They are a transgender/genderqueer writer interested in questions of
          identity and its relationship to the natural world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          All of Crouse’s stories in these two books, in fact, deeply observe
          both inner and outer landscapes. The characters involved operate on
          the margins of society and/or are caught in traumatic situations;
          there are reasons they live in edge places like the outskirts of
          Fairbanks or are in some kind of transition between lives or
          circumstances. They struggle with weather and balky vehicles, and with
          who they are. They tell stories, they lie, they live in their
          imaginations. They leave places, partners, and family and return to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three novellas each feature well-realized women as their central
          characters; each is a fascinating study of human behavior under
          stress. Each story’s construction mimics the crazily imaginative minds
          of the women; distorted time sequences disorient the reader as well as
          the character. The effect is three wild rides in which every element,
          every scene, builds from intrigue and confusion into resolutions rich
          in understanding and empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first, “Misfortune and Its Double” a young couple has left
          Fairbanks for jobs in the Lower 48. In the opening scene, a kind man
          buys the couple a restaurant meal. “That small kindness happened ten
          days into the trip, when our trouble sometimes seemed like an exotic
          country we were visiting as wide-eyed tourists.” There’s been an
          accident, an injury. We gradually become aware that the mind of the
          traumatized Wendy, beginning back in Canada and lurching down the
          highway, may not be translating reality. We’re back and forth in time,
          in place, in and out of imagination. The road trip and the tension
          between what is and what might be, propel this story in surprising,
          illuminating directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second story begins with a disturbed woman on the phone to a
          crisis line, awaiting the arrival of Fairbanks police. We gradually
          learn that a current upset in her life has triggered an old trauma.
          “She remembered it now as if it was happening again, his boot on the
          side of the boat and then his arms reaching out. Then he was falling
          sideways and his face didn’t even have time to register his fear.”
          Crouse’s compassionate depiction of a mental health crisis and its
          aftermath exemplify the power of fiction to share and understand the
          lives of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third story, the owner of a comic shop organizes Dungeons &
          Dragons games. “Being a dungeon master is close to godhood. I stand
          outside the action, but my presence is found in everything. I’m the
          voice of every monster and barmaid, the scheme of every villain, and
          the sage advice of every friendly wizard they meet along the journey.”
          Highly imaginative, Kim extends her role into the lives of the
          youthful players, including a young Native man who has gone missing
          and a teenage girl who kissed him as part of the game. Time folds back
          upon itself, and a cold Fairbanks winter permeates the scenes and
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the separate collection “I’m Here,” the 12 stories feature a wider
          variety of characters — outsiders, outcasts, failures in enterprises
          or relationships, in confused or oppositional states, literally in the
          woods, in flight. As with the novellas, identity is a key ingredient.
          Who am I, and who am I to others? Some of this has to do with gender
          and sexuality, others with relationships with parents, partners, and
          strangers. There are lots of secrets in these stories, lots of
          infidelities and disappointments. These are largely dark stories in
          which the characters nonetheless seek and often find not just purpose
          but joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first story, a teenage girl has flown to Fairbanks to visit her
          father, “the kind of man who had to run to the edge of the world to
          find himself” and who was dying of cancer. In another, another teenage
          girl is hauled to Alaska by a mother fleeing her marriage. In yet
          another, an aging and delusional woman relives her youth as a welder
          on the Alaska pipeline and a time in which she confronted men shooting
          at wolves.
        </p>
        <p>
          In “The Alaska Girl,” a man in Massachusetts, in marital and financial
          crisis, has fixated on an internet relationship with a girl in Sitka.
          He likely knows she’s not real but fantasizes about her anyway,
          sending and receiving texts. As he goes about his day, which involves
          avoiding a banker and buying expensive things he can’t afford, he’s
          also texting a girlfriend with whom he’s feuding and another woman
          he’s recently met. He’s caught in a crazy trap of his own making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Altogether, the fictive worlds that Crouse shares in these two books
          are vibrantly alive with possibility and the consequences of being
          human. Readers will be tossed through mysteries and emotions, wrapped
          in piercing, sensual language, and come away with new appreciations of
          our shared place and time. The best fiction does that — takes us away
          and then back, to better know ourselves.

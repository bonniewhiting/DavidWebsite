        <h2>The Persuader</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            He named it and the name stuck through the births of five children
            and the move from Revere to the farm where mostly it stood upright
            in the corner of the outbuilding, taller than any of the boys and
            smelling of iron and rust and its own heavy mythology. They did not
            even dare to touch it and they knew that if they did they wouldn't
            be able to lift it, maybe two of them holding it end to end, but
            then why would they do that? To bring it where and for what purpose?
            Possibly to hide it, to send him searching, searching for them,
            screaming like a madman through the house up to the bedrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            He liked to wear it like Jesus wore the cross, draped across his
            shoulders but with hands hanging loosely. The children watched him
            sometimes move across the field from the barn, always at dusk when
            the work was done and always east to the rutted road where the
            crumbling Model A did its work of slow decay, a cracked pine stump
            under each wheel well. Then he'd flex his shoulders, pause, and turn
            around, walking even faster up to the other side of the barn and
            around in a wide loop. When he came around the corner they could
            finally see his face. His eyes almost closed, mouth agape, an animal
            in its yoke. He seemed so pleased, even amused, although if he had
            noticed them that would have spoiled everything. This was one of
            their goals: to see him without being noticed, to make the yelling
            thing stomping through the house a lie.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he died—it seemed impossible that such a thing should happen,
            even years later—the Persuader stood in its corner for weeks until
            finally Toby, the second oldest, strode inside. First he made the
            delicate adjustment—he turned the wheel so that the jaws tightened.
            Then he gripped the handle with both hands and hefted it up to his
            chest, carried it up to the house. He had been home from Korea for
            two months but it seemed to him that he was returning just now and
            somehow he had carried this thing the whole way. He wanted to show
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            When his mother saw she looked at him the way she had once when he
            had carried a dead rabbit past the threshold. Aunts and uncles sat
            around in the kitchen in folding chairs eating cake from small
            plates. His brothers were out on the back porch talking about what
            needed to be done. She said, “Lord, that stupid thing,” but her
            expression softened. She smiled. She said, “Do you know how he got
            that?”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Once Toby had seen a plane crash on the deck of the carrier. It took
            off, hung in the air, a bird suspended in the wind, and then lurched
            to one side and exploded further on down the strip. Debris rolled to
            the carrier's edge and toppled into the sea. Everyday planes left on
            their bombing runs and most of the time they returned, but this was
            different, this was his most intimate contact with death. He was
            almost grateful. But then he returned home to find a wall erected
            against that story and all the others. They were glad he was
            safe—that was all. He returned to the small bed and his room except
            now he sometimes smoked cigarettes there. His brother in the next
            bed told him to stop it, then asked for one himself. His father was
            not there to yell at them. Toby imagined the heart attack as a
            similar accident to the plane crash, that same surprising lurching
            movement, the same sudden vanishing of power. Why had it happened?
            They had found his father in a bed of straw with his hand around a
            rope. The other end lead to the horse's bridle and it stood waiting
            for its master to guide it. Now Toby could smoke and swear and come
            and go as he pleased. The house seemed larger. He seemed larger too.
            He practically filled the kitchen holding the old wrench. Only his
            mother had shrunken.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are people, many people, most of them men, who live from
            moment to moment and are as undependable as weather. The man who
            owned The Persuader was that kind of man—that's what his mother
            said—and that's how it came to his father, her husband, a man who
            was that other man's opposite. She said, “It was when we lived on
            the coast. I was nineteen and we had been married for less than a
            year.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The aunts and uncles cut the cake with the sides of their forks but
            they were listening, small talking yielding to something more
            important. It was winter and the floor lay wet with melted snow. He
            repositioned the wrench in his hands. He guessed it weighed
            twenty-five, thirty pounds, long as the kitchen table and colder
            than he thought possible. His hands ached from gripping it—it seemed
            to contain the accumulated cold of all those winters it had spent
            out there. Bringing it inside was one thing but setting it down
            quite another so he held it uncomfortably as his mother spoke. “I
            remember him,” she said. “He had been bitten by something. On his
            face. Or possibly kicked by a horse? He had a scar in a strange
            shape on his cheek. A jaw or a hoof. Who knows? I wasn't about to
            ask. He kept touching it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “A drunk,” she added. “I had no use for him.” But he needed money
            right away—he owed money on a bar tab—and he would show her husband,
            Toby's father, a special thing out in the bed of his truck. Possibly
            a trade could be arranged?
          </p>
          <p>
            His father had been eating dinner with his wife at one of the small
            tables at the back but he said that yes, it was at least worth a
            look. The men moved outside along with a couple of others caught up
            in the tide of the moment. Did they think there might be a fight?
            Toby's father stood six foot three, the other man a good half a foot
            shorter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before his mother finished her baked potato her husband came in
            holding it and—she swore to this—he was grinning. He'd settle up the
            man's tab and buy him one more on top of that. In fact, he'd buy a
            round for the bar. Not an extravagant gesture, really—the place was
            almost empty—but strange from Toby's father, a person who did not
            drink and saved money in a lock box under his bed. The wrench
            thumped on the bar and everybody gathered around. Nobody had ever
            seen such a thing. Possibly it had been used to build ships. That's
            what the man said. He was already on his next drink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toby had already claimed it. Let the others talk about the animals,
            the paint mixing machines and brushes and ladders, the drill presses
            and saws, all that stuff that had allowed his father to ride out the
            great depression, even thrive when others were barely holding on.
            Many of those things, he decided, had probably come from other
            defeated men. The barn contained the history of those failures. They
            could have them. He wanted this useless thing and he wanted his
            mother to keep talking in this easy way. At the time he had thought
            it was his entrance that had done such a thing and not the simple
            fact of his father's death. Later she'd meet someone else, travel to
            England and Ireland, send him misspelled letters describing her
            strange happiness. They seemed to come from a young girl.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then he'd be living in Buffalo and studying until late at night
            in his rented room. The letters arrived as a reminder that he had
            once lived a different life. He knew they came only to him.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Anything had seemed possible in those first years after his father's
            death. It was as if the farm had been destroyed in that instant. It
            remained as an afterimage. Always it had loomed in his future and
            then it was gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            He couldn't remember exactly how long that feeling had lasted but it
            stretched through the early years of his marriage, the birth of his
            first child—even as things went bad the feeling remained. He hadn't
            known it was a rare gift until much later, when he discovered it had
            deserted him.
          </p>
          <p>
            They moved into the house in Everett in sixty-four and out in
            seventy- one after the first bankruptcy and trial separation. He sat
            at the kitchen table smoking a cigarette—a habit that had stuck—when
            his wife came into the room holding a box of dishes. He said, “How
            does it feel to be married to an imposter?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She said, “Can the man pretending to be my husband help with these
            boxes?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Their girl ran clockwise around the table, then, as if in response
            to a secret signal, corkscrewed back in the other direction.
            Throughout the afternoon they would sometimes stop to gently
            reprimand her. “Karen,” they'd say. “We're very busy right now. This
            is not a good time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She stopped now to watch them with that intense stare of hers. Three
            years old and that stare could make a cat nervous. He said, “Why
            don't you go on the porch.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do as your father says,” his wife told her. She turned back to him
            and shifted the weight of the box. It said dishes on it quite
            clearly in her neat handwriting. He could hear her brother in the
            other room moving around furniture. “Everything okay in there?” he
            called out
          </p>
          <p>“Everything's fine,” she called back.</p>
          <p>
            She left with the box trailing their girl and returned with empty
            arms. She stood in front of the refrigerator and opened both doors
            wide. “There's still food in here,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>“Leave it,” he said. “Who cares?”</p>
          <p>“Hot dogs,” she said. “Lettuce. Half an onion.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah,” he said.</p>
          <p>“Don't smoke in here,” she said.</p>
          <p>
            He didn't respond but he licked his thumb and finger and snuffed the
            cigarette, put it carefully in the pocket of his flannel shirt. Then
            he rose to his feet. “Back to work,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Down in the basement he turned off the water and hacksawed the
            copper piping. He set it in lengths on the floor, did the rough math
            in his head. When he came back upstairs his wife was missing, maybe
            up in the attic, maybe gone altogether. He turned a doorknob and
            decided they would be worth taking. He knelt with a screwdriver and
            began to unfasten it, then the next and the next, up to the second
            floor, where he decided the radiators would be more work but to a
            better end. At one hundred bucks a pop they would be worth the
            struggle. He put his back into turning the pipe fastener.
          </p>
          <p>
            A voice sounded out from behind him, “I'm not going to judge,” it
            said, “but think about what you're doing.” It was his wife, of
            course.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We need the money,” he said. “Let them foreclose. But they can
            foreclose on the bones.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That man you were talking about earlier? The imposter? Sometimes I
            feel like I still love him a little.”
          </p>
          <p>“Wait until I actually get it out of here.”</p>
          <p>“There are five more downstairs. Three up here.”</p>
          <p>
            “You've already counted. What you said about love? That works both
            ways.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He strained his back until he thought it might break but nothing
            came loose. He paused and flexed his hands. They were red and wet
            and his wife seemed to be losing patience with him. He wasn't sure
            why he cared but he did and he went back to it from a different
            angle. He could feel the muscles in his neck pop and the expression
            on his face must have been two steps past human. He gave out a
            shout, a guttural swear, another, another, back down the long
            corridor of time at the man who had first installed this stupid
            thing. He hadn't even thought about how he might get it downstairs:
            it must weigh a hundred and fifty pounds of metal carved with vines
            and flowers. He swore and tug and his wife stepped in closer,
            watching his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            He swore again and gave the whole mess a kick. He looked over at his
            tool box. Maybe the hacksaw again?
          </p>
          <p>She said, “This is why.”</p>
          <p>“It's just a thing,” he said.</p>
          <p>
            He gave it another kick as if to prove his point. It shook and the
            reverberation passed through the floorboards and very faintly
            through the rest of the house. “Is everything okay?” the brother
            called up.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Still okay,” the wife called down. “He's just upset at an inanimate
            object. Is Karen fine?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah,” he said. “She's eating a popsicle.”</p>
          <p>
            He could feel the sweat cooling on his skin, on the back of his neck
            and his arms. “Wait,” he said. “I have an idea.”
          </p>
          <p>“Great,” she said.</p>
          <p>
            He ran downstairs, past his daughter, down to the basement. For a
            moment he thought of salvaging the cigarette from his pocket but he
            ignored that impulse and rifled through cabinets. Their wedding
            pictures had been shoved down here, baby pictures, old lamps and a
            dead lawnmower he had always meant to repair.
          </p>
          <p>
            He found it behind the boxes of toilet paper and tissues. He lifted
            it up for the first time in years, heavier than he remembered, or
            possibly he had weakened. Years had passed, after all. When he came
            upstairs she said, “What the hell is that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The persuader,” he said, and he fastened it tight, put all his back
            into it. She gasped in surprise when it all came loose. Some water
            dribbled onto the floor but not much. He did it again and then a
            third time, until he could unscrew it the rest of the way with his
            hand. She found a towel and they got on their hands and knees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toby gathered the radiators in the front room. He didn't know if he
            was making his life better or worse by doing this but he was doing
            it. Karen ran her fingers along the metal. Now that the radiators
            had been freed from their normal use they seemed miraculous and
            strange to her. “Don't climb on them,” he said, but his voice was
            even, almost kind. His wife's brother came up behind him and made a
            little noise but that was the only sign of judgment he gave. Then he
            moved off to some other part of the house.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a moment nothing had happened. He felt her eyes on him as he
            strained and he decided that this would be his final failure and
            then, just on the heels of that thought, no, there will be more. But
            then the rush of release and her surprised noise making. Later after
            he had removed two more radiators he sat at the kitchen table
            drinking a glass of water and said, “Did I ever tell why my father
            named it that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I saw why,” she said. She was smiling faintly. Her brother was
            outside now waiting for her but she seemed to have decided to let
            him wait for a few minutes while they talked. Her hair was a mess
            and her clothes were covered with dust but yes, she was smiling, but
            sadly, at the whole of the house and what had just transpired. Later
            he knew that they'd probably fight about the money from the
            radiators—he'd demand more than half—but just then they occupied a
            small space between arguments.
          </p>
          <p>“That's not what I meant,” he said. “It was a joke.”</p>
          <p>
            His father did not tell jokes. But that had been one. The naming of
            it. It was like a dog deciding to meow, that kind of funny, and
            explaining it to his wife would drain the humor from it with each
            word. His brothers would understand but he had lost touch with them
            over the past decade. His mother had died in Scotland last spring,
            had even been buried there.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He got it from a drunk,” he said, but in trying to resurrect the
            story he realized how much of it could not be brought back. The
            barest scraps remained and those were dried out and uninteresting.
            “I should finish this up,” he said. His hands ached and something
            had happened to his knee. He slid his chair back and stood with some
            difficulty, both hands on the table for balance. That would have to
            go too. He'd give it to her.
          </p>
          <p>“I'll help a little more,” she said.</p>
          <p>
            He took the wrench with him, set on the front seat like a passenger.
            His wife took Karen.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            “I'm telling you that you can't come over,” Karen said. “Not now and
            not ever. Can you understand that? It's done. I'm done. Okay? Are
            you listening to me?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She wasn't screaming but she wasn't exactly speaking either. Her
            voice hung in some middle place between hysteria and reason. She had
            been living in that middle place for weeks, when waiting in line at
            the grocery store or running by the river in the early morning.
            She'd see someone who looked something like him—the barest
            implication of him in the way a body filled its clothes and moved
            through the air—and she'd go rigid and cold. Nineteen and her first
            real lover had turned into a maniac.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often she thought she had turned him into one—he had been so sweet
            in those early stages of their courtship—but of course that was
            ridiculous. Still she could not help but think that she had unlocked
            something inside him and now that it was out in the world she could
            not put it back in that soft, dark place where it had stayed hidden
            for those five months of restaurants and long talks and tentative
            lovemaking in his drab student apartment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Just an hour,” he said. “You waste that much time watching TV shows
            you don't even like.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He wanted to come over and speak to her in person, explain his
            perspective, and his voice was the more reasonable sounding of the
            two. Anybody hearing their inflection and volume, a person listening
            in, would have considered her the crazy one. And she felt like the
            crazy one now too. The more he talked the more reasonable he seemed
            and more unfair and ridiculous she became. She hadn't even explained
            to him why she had cut it off. She had treated him poorly, delivered
            the news by letter and—she knew this and thought he did too—she had
            lied to him, a slant of the truth so it caught the light in a
            slightly more attractive way. Those were the kinds of lies men
            usually told, her father being a good example, and they told them to
            themselves as much as to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'm in bed,” she said. “I'm practically asleep,” which was also not
            true. She added, “We've talked so much already. At some point it's
            impossible to listen anymore, you know?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He explained that he had spent a lot of time on her, doing things he
            didn't necessarily enjoy. He did not enjoy art museums, for
            instance, and he did not enjoy baseball, but he had done both of
            those things for her. Now she could pay him back in some small way.
            Then if she wanted she'd never have to see him again. He'd transfer
            to a different college even, or go back home to Wyoming and live
            with his parents for a year. “Shoveling cow poop,” he said, and she
            saw his shy smile in her mind's eye. She paced the room as he spoke,
            the phone cord sometimes tangling around her wrist like a bracelet.
            Occasionally one of her housemates peeked into the room and she
            mouthed some silent words back at them.
          </p>
          <p>
            His dislike of the museum was news to her and it hurt her to think
            of him being bored as they moved from room to room, from romantics
            to minimalists to—and remembering the day she suddenly realized he
            had been most bored at this point—the expressionists. During this
            walk she had told him about her hidden ambitions. She wanted to
            travel, and not just to Britain and Europe, but Russia, East
            Germany, China, South America. There were many other ways to live.
            She knew that but did not know the details. She told him this and
            thought he understood because of his quietness and patience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes when they made love she thought of her hands on a
            different body, a woman, sometimes someone she knew and sometimes a
            complete fantasy summoned from the ether, and she knew with a new
            conviction that this was also something she wanted in her future.
            This was the thing absent from her letter that made it a lie, and
            omitting it had made her want it even more. It seemed as
            simultaneously impossible and natural as riding a taxi through a
            Parisian street. But all she wanted to do in this moment was run
            along the river and watch the lights on the boats at their moorings.
            It seemed odd that people might be out there on the water. The
            height of casual decadence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Look,” he said. “I'm coming over. I don't even have to come inside.
            We can talk in your backyard. But I have to see your face.”
          </p>
          <p>“Why?” she asked. “Why do have to see my face?”</p>
          <p>“I just do,” he said, and the line went dead.</p>
          <p>
            She dropped the phone and listened to it buzz. The operator came on
            and asked if everything was okay and still she didn't move. She
            thought about another boy, sixteen, who had angered her father when
            he had honked his car horn in the driveway. For the first time since
            she had cut him out of her life she wished that he was here, all
            that anger directed at someone who deserved it. Except that Peter
            didn't deserve it, nobody deserved her dad's bitterness. Better that
            he was gone. Last she had heard he lived somewhere out in southern
            Texas. For a flash she imagined that it was him coming over, beer
            cans in the back of his old Impala, always ready to say I love you
            over and over like he was trying to convince himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peter lived four blocks away. He'd be walking, maybe running, so
            that didn't give her much time. “Is everything okay?” the operator
            asked. “Hello?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes,” she said, and she put the phone back in its cradle.</p>
          <p>
            They were watching Reagan in the living room. He was talking about
            Russia again in his fatherly way. If you just listened to the sound
            of the voice it was easy to believe that he was talking about a
            different time and that there were no troubles at all in the world.
            But all the voice did now was annoy here. She said, “I'm going out,”
            and a few heads nodded. She was pulling on her windbreaker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sherri said, “I'm going to kill him when he comes here you know,”
            but she was still watching the face on the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            She headed out toward the back but she could hear a commotion in the
            front. He was coming in as she was going out and she could hear
            Betty yelling, “She's not here. She's not here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She had miscalculated. She turned and saw a glimpse of his bright
            orange cap through the hallway but she wouldn't let herself stop and
            focus. She hit the porch striding because she refused to run away
            from him. She'd leave as if she were just a little bit late. That's
            the only urgency she'd give this moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except that as she stepped out onto the stairs she saw the cap
            again. It was the one he wore when bicycling so he wouldn't be hit
            by traffic and she had once said that he looked cute in it. He was
            coming around the house full throttle and the second thing she
            noticed was that his glasses had fallen off and the sight of him
            without them elicited a momentary feeling of tenderness. She was
            used to seeing his naked face only after sex or a shower or that one
            time when she told him it was over the first time and he began to
            cry. She imagined them on the ground somewhere between the front of
            the house and the back, waiting to be destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            She slammed the door but he shouldered it in and then she spun and
            had to break her vow. She was running now. She slammed the screen
            door but he pushed that open too and by then it had become a game,
            up through the stairs and he was trailing three other girls now but
            what would they do if they caught him? She headed to her room and
            shut that door too but there was no lock and even though she put all
            her weight into it she did not weigh much more than a hundred
            pounds, him double that. The door shuddered and then inched open and
            he said, “What the hell are we doing? It doesn't have to be this
            way. All I wanted to do was sit on your stoop and hold hands.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Her friends were standing in the hall watching. One of them, it was
            Sherri, yelled, “Get out of here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She could see a small slice of his face in the space between door
            and wall: his nose and cheek and a single eye. His mouth breathing
            heavy and a tangle of wet hair across his forehead. He seemed to be
            showing some restraint, holding her back, allowing her to keep the
            door just a little bit closed. Speaking to him was an impossibility
            though. What would she say? If she began to talk the word please
            would keep coming forever. Her friends were all screaming now.
          </p>
          <p>
            A physics major. She could not believe that her wrists had been
            bruised by a physics major, that a physics major had grabbed her
            hair and pushed her down on the ground. Her palms had both scraped
            on the tar and come up bloody and he had said, “What are you doing?”
            like it was her fault. A physics major, someone who did whatever
            people like that did—he had tried to explain it but she didn't
            understand. She just liked to read novels and then talk about them
            and even the talking part she could do without.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Karen,” he said. “Stop it,” like she was the one pushing into his
            room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The door gave way and then he was there, standing on her little shag
            rug still breathing deep and heavy.

            She didn't know what to do so she fell onto all fours like a dog. He
            stepped forward and she scrambled around the bed, digging around,
            and came up with it, more than four feet long, the stupid thing he
            had given her along with its stupid name which she couldn't remember
            anymore. A club of a thing she had to grip with both hands and even
            then it threatened to pull her down. She lurched forward and
            screamed, “Get the fuck out,” and then, “I'll cave your head in.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The faces watched from the doorway. For some reason she wanted to
            scare them too but of course him most of all.
          </p>
          <p>
            She wished she could remember the story behind it but really that
            didn't matter because if she swung it around and it hit the side of
            his head it would have a very important effect. He knew that. It
            showed in his expression. He had a very intelligent mind and he was
            probably calculating the odds of it connecting if he moved forward.
          </p>
          <p>She shook it the air as if to ward off evil spirits.</p>
          <p>
            The girls in the doorway began to hoot and howl and one of them
            laughed and swore at his back. He was surrounded, sort of, and she
            could tell he certainly hadn't planned it this way. A physics major
            with books almost as heavy as the weapon she held in her hands.
          </p>
          <p>“I just want to talk,” he said.</p>
          <p>
            She felt the swear words vomit up from some deep place just above
            her sternum. He was the one who had opened that up in her. She
            pushed the wrench forward in a stabbing motion. He was the bull and
            she was the matador and there was even a crowd and they knew who to
            root for in these difficult times. He stumbled back and she kept
            moving, arcing the wrench, stabbing, thrusting. He reached out but
            in such a half-hearted way that he seemed to be saying goodbye. His
            hands, she noticed, were bloody at the thumbs. He had been biting
            his nails badly again, working the soft flesh around the cuticle.
            She was always telling him to stop that. It was like he wanted to
            eat himself alive, she sometimes told him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He reached out again to slap at the thing and then, finally with
            some decisive, he made a hard grab at it. But she had anticipated
            that and she pulled it the other way across her body in a wide arc
            like a sword. The thing touched his shoulder and pushed him back and
            her housemates parted and then he was moving down the stairs and out
            of her life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterward they took turns holding it and laughing at its absurd
            weight.

            Her father had never done much for her but he had given her this
            thing when she had moved away and even placed it under her bed where
            it had stayed for two years with the dust bunnies and shoe boxes.
            The other girls were laughing one of the smallest, a plucky,
            smart-mouthed girl from Tennessee, was trying to heft it above her
            head in a pose of triumph that simultaneously celebrated victory and
            made fun of all that macho stuff like muscles and tools, violence
            and pride. She even let out a small roar as she lifted but then back
            to Karen because she was the one who owned it.

            Something important in the naming of an object, almost like naming a
            dog or a child, but the name was gone. And that loss, she truly felt
            it as a loss, balanced the adrenalin rush. She vaguely remembered
            her grandfather tricking someone—she couldn't remember the
            specifics—into giving the thing up and then it had come to her
            father and then to her but what was it called? Hard to remember,
            impossible really, and even harder to pick up the phone and dial her
            father's number. But that's what she did later that night. She would
            have not have been surprised if a stranger's voice answered.
          </p>
          <p>“Hello,” he said.</p>
          <p>
            “It's me,” she said. Three years of silence and two more before that
            when all she could do was say yes and no between bites at the
            kitchen table during weekend visits. He lived in a different house
            now, one she had never stepped inside, but she could imagine the
            dishes high in the sink, the back porch smelling of oil and engine
            parts and carpet coming up at the browned edges. She knew this would
            accomplish nothing but she had to ask.

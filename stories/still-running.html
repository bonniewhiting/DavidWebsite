            “I want you to guess,” I said. My father's house was in the hands of
            the realtors, my father was in the ground, and there I was, playing
            games again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Are you okay?” Beth asked. I turned around to look at her, my
            jacket in my hands, and she stared hard at my face, like there was
            something wrong with my mouth or eyes. I must have looked tired. I
            had been through a lot the last few days, more than she knew, and
            all I wanted to do was sleep.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, yeah,” I said. “I'm fine. I'm fine. Now guess.”</p>
          <p>
            “Abraham Lincoln,” she said, with an edge in her voice. “The Virgin
            Mary. The Wizard of Oz.”
          </p>
          <p>“Leslie McKenzie,” I said, like the answer was obvious.</p>
          <p>
            She grabbed the suit coat from me and slipped it onto its hanger,
            then reached into one of its pockets and pulled out a balled-up
            Kleenex. I took some loose black socks from the suitcase. She took
            those too, and stuffed one down into another, pairing them up.
            “Who's that?” she asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This guy I grew up with. I've talked about him before, don't you
            remember? And he was thin as a rail, Beth. This guy was the fattest
            thing you've ever seen back in high school and now he's a string
            bean. He's like the 'after' picture they use in the commercials.” I
            was grinning like this was the most miraculous thing in the whole
            world, like it was something to put in the Guinness Book of World
            Records next to someone with seven foot long fingernails. “The
            little weasel must have kept at it,” I said, and I imagined Leslie
            McKenzie chugging down the side of the road in his jogging shorts.
            How many miles had he clocked up by now? Enough to get clear across
            the country, I figured, all the way from our hometown of historical
            Haverhill, Massachusetts. Even though I had been there that morning,
            when I thought about running those miles instead of flying them, it
            seemed so far away that it might as well have been Neptune.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth had reached the phone first when the hospital called. The
            ringing had interrupted a real steamer of an argument, and as she
            put the receiver to her ear, I had decided, in the way a person can
            decide something quickly and with detachment, that I was going to
            nudge the fight further along when she was finished her private
            little conversation. There had been something secretive in the set
            of her shoulders, the bend of her neck, and her whispered, “Yes.”
            Unknown to me, the doctor had been telling her slowly and patiently
            that my father had died.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Are you sure you're okay?” she said, as I pushed my empty suitcase
            into the back of the closet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shut the closet door, turned to her, and said, “Are you even
            listening to what I'm saying?”
          </p>
          <p>“I'm listening,” she said.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            My buddies and I, we had noticed Leslie was up to something, that
            first summer when he began to huff and puff around town. I have to
            admit that our feelings about it were very complex. Why shouldn't
            they have been? I mean, Leslie McKenzie, all two hundred fifty
            something pounds of him, running down the side of the road. No, not
            running, not then anyway. Shuffling, staggering, half-sliding his
            sneakers through the gutter dirt. Anything, any word, but running.
            His eyes half-closed as if he were falling asleep, little fists
            balled at stomach height, the front of his T-shirt darkened with
            sweat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who wouldn't have been surprised and dumbfounded? It was an offense
            against the natural order of things. It was an offense against us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were content that first time to yell something out the window as
            we drove by. We were heading to the beach, I think, and couldn't be
            troubled to even slow down for such a thing, but someone—I'm pretty
            sure it wasn't me—leaned out his window and yelled something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing us it was a good insult, but to Leslie it must have sounded
            like a wordless yell. Just a whoosh of air as the car passed and the
            sight of our rear bumper as we sped off to the beach, or the lake,
            or the quarry, or wherever the hell we were going. One place was as
            good as another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leslie would have recognized the car, a 82 Chevy Impala with a long
            dent in the rear bumper. It pulls out of sight and what does he do?
            Does he speed up, angry now, using that stupid broken rear bumper,
            the duck-taped rear window, as a goal, a target? Does he slow down
            now that nobody's watching? Does he stop right there on the side of
            the road and double over and take big, rasping breaths? Or does he
            simply keep running at the same steady pace, eyes half-closed, as if
            we were never there at all? I've wondered about that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know what we did, not because I remember it specifically, but
            because it's what we always did in that car. We laughed and sang
            along to whatever song was on the radio, and jostled each other
            around if we were in the backseat, and we didn't say anything about
            Leslie. But I think we all knew what we had to do, because Leslie
            had plans. He had a whole summer, almost three months, and he had
            obviously hatched some kind of mo-fo scheme to recreate himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had the resources to do it too, if not the motivation. His
            parents had already probably bought him a set of those expensive
            weights covered in plastic, the ones that looks futuristic and
            effeminate at the same time. I mean, this kid had more sweaters than
            I had I-don't-know-what.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hunch we all shared was confirmed by other sightings later in
            the week: the same road, the same time, the same duh-duh-duh
            expression, the same shirt probably. Henry Eubank's kid sister rode
            past him on her bike. Erik saw him too. And me. I saw him when
            driving my father's car to the grocery store to get beer and
            cigarettes and a few other things for him. I remember because I had
            a bag of groceries on the car seat next to me: a loaf of bread,
            dishwashing liquid, two gallons of chocolate ice cream, which was
            the only flavor my father ate. That's when I had the idea, although
            I didn't implement it until later, and Erik even took the credit for
            it for some fucking reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it was definitely confirmed. Leslie McKenzie was planning some
            kind of image makeover. Lose a few pounds, grow his hair out longer
            and stop slicking it across the top of his head like a fifty year
            old bank clerk, get a new pair of thin framed glasses and
            abracadabra, he was going to expect even more from the world. He had
            seen his opportunity—nobody was looking—and he was going to go for
            it, which was probably an expression he was going to end up using
            eventually, if he had his way.
          </p>
          <p>
            It really pissed me off. I'm not exactly sure why, except that it
            seemed like he was trying to pull one over on me, on us. He was
            being all sneaky and passive aggressive. I'm not saying that we were
            angels in any way, not at all, but you had to think, what was this
            kid going to our school for anyway? He lived in that house up on
            East Broadway that had a rod iron fence around it, an actual rod
            iron fence, like it was a museum or something. His father, who was a
            doctor or lawyer, could have afforded to send him to Phillips
            Andover Academy and then he wouldn't have gotten any shit from us at
            all, because we never would have even known each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's another way of looking at it: our haircuts, the clothes we
            wore and the cars we drove-our parent's cars, really, other than
            Erik, who owned the Impala. All that stuff, everything about the way
            we looked, was so totally connected to who we were inside that the
            two were practically the same. That's one of the main things I
            remember from that time, the sheer simplicity of those drives in
            Erik's Chevy. Those trips were beautiful and almost spellbinding in
            their clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here is this guy who wants to open up this gigantic rift between
            himself-the person he is on the inside-and who he is on the outside.
            I mean, I shouldn't get angry-it's been years-but I still remember
            that watch he used to wear, and the shoes, and the smell of
            something kind of sweet like peppermint from him in gym class. And
            now he takes up running. He wants to make his own body into some
            kind of disguise, like he's Batman!
          </p>

            And he wasn't just running. If it was just that, well, I don't know,
            but there was other stuff going on. Once when I was walking by his
            house-sometimes I found myself walking by there for some reason-I
            saw him out on his lawn, lying flat on his back on a lawn chair
            wearing only swimming trunks and Risky Business sunglasses, fucking
            sunglasses. Just lying there, all four hundred eighty pounds of him,
            although by this time it was probably more like four hundred sixty
            something. And every single pound of it was working overtime
            absorbing those rays, just soaking them up in a way that seemed
            almost greedy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave some of that sun for the rest of us, Porky, I wanted to say
            when I saw him there. I wasn't that angry or anything-I had more
            important things on my mind-but it did miff me a little. My father
            was acting all crazy that day, I remember, and I had gotten out of
            the house and was just wandering around. And then I stumble across
            this, like I'm stepping in a turd. Well, maybe not exactly, but I'm
            just saying that there was some justification for what I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes thinking about my father leads me to think about his
            father, a man I never knew, and then his father, and further down
            the chain of sullen men with receding chins and a tendency to lose
            their hair early in life. When I think like this, it seems like
            there is something I can find if I keep going back and back and
            back, like this is all just as simple and difficult as digging very
            deeply into the ground. It's like there's something out there, on
            the edge of history, and that's the thing I can blame.

            “I don't know if we're happy,” Beth said. This is how she put it the
            first time, when she began talking about separating, when she said
            she was thinking of moving in with her sister and getting her head
            together. There were a million things she wanted to do with her
            life, two million things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth wants to be a physical therapist. She wants to take care of the
            elderly, give them comfort them when they need comfort. I'm
            supporting her while she goes to school, and paying her tuition, and
            I like the idea of doing good through her, since that has never
            really been one of my areas of expertise. I'm a computer engineer,
            and although I don't like to talk about my work, I like it when she
            tells me about what she's learning. Sometimes she touches my hand
            and tells me the names of the bones in my fingers. I never would
            have imagined how many.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We're not happy,” she said, and her comment seemed like such a
            simple and basic thing that I hadn't even thought about it until she
            pointed it out. Like breathing or something. Happiness. I was
            dumbfounded.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, hey,” I said. “What the hell?”</p>
          <p>
            We were driving for some stupid reason, some soul-killing errand
            like getting paint for the bathroom or ant traps to put under the
            kitchen sink. I was listening to a good song on the radio and
            thinking about nothing except the car in front of me, which was
            going too slow, and the car behind, which was going too fast, and
            now we had to begin and end a conversation about the sorry state of
            a marriage in the ten minutes it was going to take us to get to
            Wal-Mart. She cracked her window and lit a cigarette.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'm happy,” I said. “Look at me. See? Don't I look happy?” I curled
            my lips back and held them that way, mouth half-open and gawking.
            This would be one of the faces I would use to make my children laugh
            if we ever had any.
          </p>
          <p>“Stop it,” she said.</p>
          <p>
            We drove for a little while in silence. We were almost halfway there
            now, and I had never thought of this particular store as being such
            a safe and comfortable place, but there it was, out there in my
            imagination, like a little beacon of goodwill and dullness. She
            finally said, “That's a scary face.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought, she's right, it would scare them, and I thought of their
            frightened little lips and eyes. Frightened by me, a person who had
            never intended any harm to anyone and who was just trying to make a
            stupid face so that his wife could share a joke at his expense.
            These are the kind of thoughts that can wear a person down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth had never liked talking about having children. She did not like
            talking about my father either, my upbringing, as she called it, as
            if I had been raised at some private school in England and not in a
            dead little mill town in Massachusetts. I said, “This is a difficult
            period. I've been tense lately,” which opened up another patch of
            silence in the conversation like I had cleared the words away with a
            machete.
          </p>
          <p>
            She said, “It's more than that,” but we were pulling into the
            parking lot now. She would be thinking of my upbringing now as we
            discussed the difference between mustard yellow and orange yellow
            and yellow yellow, and so would I, and it felt like she had pushed
            me into that place, like she was putting these thoughts in my head.
            She was like one of these people who talked about bodily functions
            at the dinner table. It was inappropriate, is what I'm saying.
          </p>
          <p>
            I parked the car and turned the key in the ignition and looked hard
            at her and said, “You know what? You're right. Do you want to talk
            about it right now? We can talk about it right now if you want.
            We're in no rush.” It was hot out, and the air-conditioner was off
            because I was holding the keys in the palm of my hand, and we were
            already feeling it.
          </p>
          <p>“No,” she said. “That's okay.”</p>
          <p>
            “Are you sure?” I said. “Because there's no time like the present.
            This is a wonderful place to talk about it. We have privacy and we
            have a view.” I looked out the windshield at the neat grids of
            parked cars and steaming blacktop and errant grocery carts.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do you think of yourself as a good listener?” I said. “Because we
            have a lot to share. As you know, I have a lot to get off my chest.”
            I smiled again and waited for her reply, but she opened the car door
            and stepped outside and I decided fine, have it your way, and caught
            up with her with a few long strides. There were clouds in the sky
            and I wanted them to just open up on us so that we would have to
            scurry into the store and get this day over with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could see the concerned faces of tired shoppers as they stepped
            outside with their cut-rate provisions, and I wondered if they were
            really any better off than Beth and me. They were using the same
            dish washing liquid, wearing the same jeans, and probably having the
            same arguments, right? We were all worried about the threat of rain
            and the cost of bacon and being found out by those closest to us. I
            put my hand on Beth's shoulder when we stopped at the door and felt
            her muscles tighten. “I just want you to talk to me,” she said.
            “Sometimes I wonder if I know you. It's like you razed your whole
            history when you met me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Which was not completely true, of course. When we met, I had been
            finishing up my seventh and last year of school, and I had told her
            how hard it had been. I hadn't boasted, not really, but she had been
            proud of me. She had said I seemed like someone who had his act
            together. I guessed she was probably in the process of reconsidering
            that now. I think if I had dropped everything right then, and turned
            and walked back to the car, she would have followed, and we could
            have driven anywhere. This was two weeks before my father's death,
            and I'm guessing that at exactly that moment he was watching
            television and drinking a beer and thinking about God-knows-what.
          </p>
          <p>
            I said to Beth, “I love you.” Or at least that's what I wanted to
            say. What I actually said was, “Let's make this quick and painless,”
            which is what I think she wanted too. I think we were thinking
            exactly the same thing, which is not something that happens often
            between two people, especially when those two people are me and my
            wife.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to talk then, in the time it took me to grip the door
            handle, open the door and step inside. I wanted to tell her
            everything, which, of course, I did not, because we were being
            greeted by an elderly woman in a blue apron who seemed as much about
            getting in our way as saying hello. And then, weeks later, with my
            father in the ground, what did I tell Beth? That I had bumped into
            an old friend of mine, and man, was I surprised—not just because he
            looked so good, but to even see him there at all, in that run-down
            little mill town.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems like you don't like this guy very much for someone who
            used to be your friend,” she said. She opened the closet and took
            out the suitcase and I remembered then that it belonged in the hall
            closet. We live in a very orderly house, and much of that is due to
            Beth. I took the suitcase from her and left the bedroom. She
            followed me. She said, “What happened back there, Gary?” She said,
            “What happened back there really?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I could ask you the same question, Beth,” I said, and my voice rose
            with mock concern. I couldn't help myself. “You seem really upset.
            Did something happen while I was gone that I should know about?” I
            opened the door in the hall and threw the suitcase inside. I was
            trying to steer my anger in the right direction, away from her,
            toward the back of the closet. “Watch the walls,” she said. “We
            don't own this house yet.”
          </p>
          <p>“We,” I said. “Is that the royal we?”</p>
          <p>
            “Sometimes you're a hard person to be around,” she said, and she
            turned and headed toward the kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tone of her voice was not lost on me. It was low and air traffic
            controller steady, the way I sometimes used to talk to my father,
            when I had the presence of mind. I could hear water running in the
            sink. “Christ,” I said. “Don't you think I know that? I know that.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The next time I saw Leslie McKenzie I was coming back from the
            market in my father's car. My father often ordered me out on errands
            right when he got home from work, partially because he was tired and
            lazy, partially because he wanted to be alone, I guess. This was
            fine with me, except that these trips were now kind of synchronized
            with Leslie's running schedule, which was annoying, you know-driving
            by him like that-especially because I didn't want to give him the
            satisfaction of changing my route.
          </p>
          <p>
            That particular day I picked up Erik and we did a little roaming
            around, and of course we end up on Kirkland Street with Leslie up
            ahead of us, chugging away. Now, instead of speeding up, I decide to
            slow down, because I want to kind of loom behind him. I want him to
            see our shadow coming, like in some horror movie.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then I remembered the idea I had the time before, except this
            time I had someone riding shotgun, so I said to Erik, “Open up the
            ice cream.” My father always wanted me to pick up the same stuff-six
            pack of Miller, a pack of Marlboro's, maybe some toilet paper-and
            chocolate ice cream, which I know for a fact that he ate until the
            day he died. There was a half-empty carton of it in his freezer when
            I went back to sell his house.
          </p>
          <p>
            Erik laughed because he must have known what I was thinking. Then he
            handed me the open container of ice cream. It was one of those
            square half-gallon containers. And as we loomed up on Leslie I
            whipped the container out the window and Erik yelled something like,
            “Eat it up!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a one in a million shot. The container hit him right on his
            ass and for a second he kept running, like it took a moment to
            register or maybe he thought he was getting dive-bombed. I didn't
            see the expression on his face or anything because I was stepping on
            the gas. Erik yelled something else, some fat joke he had probably
            used six times before, and then we were gone, leaving Leslie on the
            side of the road with a half-gallon of my father's ice cream melting
            in the dirt.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father was in his chair with his clicker, blundering through the
            channels, when I got home. He yelled out to the kitchen as I came
            in. I noticed he had already eaten his dinner. His dirty plate was
            in the sink, smeared with ketchup. I opened the freezer and
            scrounged around as he wandered in and peeled the shrink-wrap off
            his cigarettes. He was still wearing his blue work shirt, so I knew
            he had had a rough day, and I was about to make myself scarce when
            he came in and said, “Where the fuck is the ice cream?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I forgot,” I said. “Sorry.” I began to walk to the living room. Out
            of the corner of my eye I saw him fiddling with his change, which I
            had left in the plastic bag for him the way I always did. He was
            doing the math in his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Did you buy beer with my money?” he asked, in that voice of his
            that let me know in no way, shape, or form was I going to pull
            anything. Not on his watch, as he sometimes liked to say.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, I didn't buy beer with your money,” I said, sing-songing his
            words back to him
          </p>
          <p>
            He followed me into the living room. The sound on the television was
            all the way down and the stereo was on and turned to the classic
            rock station. Both of our eyes wandered to the television, where a
            woman was turning letters on a game show, and for a second I thought
            the whole thing was a dead issue, but then he said, “How you make it
            through the day is a mystery to me. What the hell is the matter with
            you?” It was like a nudge, like, come on, let's see what happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, shut the fuck up, it's just a carton of ice cream,” I said, or
            something like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then suddenly the music on the stereo kind of turned inside out,
            is the only way to describe it, and my head filled with colors, and
            the room grew long and narrow, like I was standing down the end of a
            long corridor instead of in the center of my father's living room.
            That's when I realized that I had just been cold-cocked. Not a wide,
            sloppy punch either. No, this was the kind of punch that a boxer
            throws, a hard jab right to the center of my face that immediately
            took every last ounce of fight out of me. My legs were just not
            registering anymore and the top of my head felt warm, like my skull
            was filling up with blood. This was a punch designed to hurt, and it
            did, but I didn't fall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I had a vision. A vision caused by pain and shock and not
            magic or God, but a vision nonetheless. I closed my eyes and felt
            the blood coming down my chin like I was a baby dribbling food out
            of my mouth and then it happened. My head filled with light. Light
            and something else. A vision of my mother, and not my mother as she
            was twelve years ago, not the mother in the pictures, but my mother
            as she would have been if she had lived and aged alongside her son
            and husband.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was standing in front of me and smiling and there was an
            expression on her face that I couldn't read, a mix of disdain and
            attraction, like I'm some kind of exotic food she didn't know if she
            should eat or not. I wasn't sure why she was there, and in that
            second that I saw her my feelings moved from happiness to annoyance,
            because she seemed to be withholding something from me. She had a
            secret and no way no how was she going to share it with me, her only
            son and a person who had just been sucker punched by his own father,
            which is one of those exclusive clubs you don't want to join.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to tell my mother that I loved her and missed her, of
            course, but I also wanted to tell her that I had secrets too, just
            so we were on equal footing, so to speak. The last twelve years of
            my life, actually, had been one big secret from her, because she was
            dead and I was alive. And that made me feel strong and sad at the
            same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then she was gone, and although just a second before her face was so
            vivid, all of a sudden I had absolutely no idea what she looked
            like, like I never saw her at all. The next thing I knew I was
            sitting on the couch and my father was pushing a glass of water into
            my hand. “Come on, drink it,” he said, and so I took it and put it
            to my mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You sure have a way of getting under my skin,” he said, and I
            looked up. He was pacing the room. I had never seen him walk that
            way before, and something about it made him look kind of small and
            feminine. I got the feeling that if I stood up and just laid into
            him right there and then, there would be nothing he could do to stop
            me, but my legs felt real weak, so I just took another sip of water
            and listened to him talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could build palaces out of the things my father didn't tell me.
            That's the stuff I remember now as much as what he did say, and
            that's what he says sometimes when he's pacing around that room in
            my memory. He tells me about the last year of her life, which must
            have been difficult, and about his own childhood on a farm in
            upstate New York, and my mother's childhood too, in Haverhill, the
            place he ran away to at eighteen, the place he died at sixty-seven.
          </p>
          <p>
            He sometimes told me about the job he used to have in Lawrence, and
            my mother, and he when he talked this way he spoke as if he was
            still puzzled and even a little amused by their absence. He would
            kind of make a noise at the back of his throat and say, “Your mother
            and I used to eat Chinese food in bed,” as if this was some habit he
            had outgrown. It was like a little window would open and close in
            the same second. But today he looked at me and said, “What are you
            looking at me like that? Are you waiting for an apology?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No,” I said, and there was such control in my voice, like I was
            walking from here to there on a thin wire. I hoped there was.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There's no reason for me to apologize,” he said. “Do you know what
            I've been through? You don't know.” It was like we were in an
            argument, an argument he was losing, but I wasn't even saying
            anything. He said, “I put a roof over your head. And I don't ask for
            much back, do I? What do I ask for?” He looked at me like he
            expected an answer. There was a pleading quality in his voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'm sorry,” I said, and my face crumpled like I had told him to go
            to hell. It was like I had hauled back and slapped him. He closed
            his eyes and tilted his chin up like he was listening to music
            playing in his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            He said, “Don't say that. Don't you apologize. Please. I don't want
            to hear it.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay,” I said. “Okay.”</p>
          <p>
            “And don't tell me you understand, okay? I don't understand you and
            there's no way that you understand me. Let's just agree on that.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay. Okay. Okay.”</p>
          <p>
            When Beth told me that he had died, I remember feeling that he had
            tricked me somehow, that he had escaped. I remember Beth repeating
            the doctor's words to me as she held my hand, and me thinking—not
            thinking but feeling—that he had gotten away with something.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm guessing I showed no sign of being upset, because that's the way
            I am. It's like I just kind of leave my body, like whoosh, and I'm
            floating outside myself, like I am alive and dead at the same time,
            a body on the earth and a ghost up above watching and wondering
            about these funny little people down below.
          </p>
          <p>
            She told me that he had died about three hours before, that it was a
            heart attack (his second), and that he actually managed to drive
            himself to the hospital, which is only about five blocks from his
            house (she referred to it as my house because it's the house I grew
            up in). She asked me if she wanted me to book my flight for me, and
            I said, no, no I can do it. She looked at me like I'm some math
            problem she was trying to figure out.
          </p>
          <p>“I'm not angry,” I said. She always thinks I'm angry.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I remember telling Erik, “I'm going to hurt him,” but when it came
            down to it, I only touched Leslie McKenzie once, and that was to
            help him. I stood over him and rested my palm against the
            sweat-covered curve of his back and I even asked him if he was okay
            and you know what he did? He hissed something beneath his breath and
            pulled away, like I had leprosy. Then he stood up and began to
            shamble away from me like he was drunk and I knew then that it was
            over.
          </p>
          <p>
            For weeks Erik and I had been following him around in Erik's car. He
            changed routes, but we always found him. I mean, how far could he go
            on two legs? When Erik got a job and a new circle of friends along
            with the job, I used my father's car when I could. I remember
            driving up alongside Leslie and sort of veering over to him like I
            was going to hit him and knock him down in the gutter, which of
            course I would never have done even if you had paid me. It was just
            a joke, and if it was a joke that got out of hand, well, we were
            just dumb kids, and maybe it was a way of bringing balance to his
            life, a life that would probably soon be full of parties and girls
            at a nice college. I wanted him to remember me, I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I want to hurt him.” That's what I actually told Erik. Not going
            to, but want, which is a very different thing. We were in Erik's
            room, where I had been hanging out for a day or two until things
            blew over at home. We were listening to music and passing a bowl
            between us, and as we took hits off it, my mouth loosened up and my
            mind cleared. “I want to hurt him in places he didn't know existed,”
            I said, and I leaned my head back and blew some smoke at the
            ceiling. I was thinking of Leslie McKenzie's heart, which I imagined
            as something large and soft and ripe, like an expensive fruit from a
            tropical country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Erik took the bowl from me and held it in front of his mouth. It
            looked like he was staring right into my eyes, right down in my
            heart, but he was really just looking at my nose, which was red and
            swollen. He was probably wondering what something like that must
            feel like. What had I told him? A fall down the stairs? The door of
            my car? Something like that. One of the many things I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            He coughed a little and passed back the bowl. I saw his face as a
            mask of my own, but this was not true. I know that now. He said,
            “Let's go see a movie or something.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don't have the money,” I said, although I had ten dollars in my
            pocket. It was my father's money, taken from his nightstand. I had
            taken it just to hold it, I think, to have it for the night,
            although when I had closed my fist around it I had been planning to
            spend it all on a couple of six packs.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'll pay,” he said, which is the first time I had ever heard that
            offer. He turned the bong to me and said, “Let's just leave him
            alone,” and I stood up and left without a word, because how much
            help had he ever been to me, anyway?
          </p>
          <p>
            That night I saw him down by the river, running along the boxboard
            drainage ditch against the flow of water, as if he were following it
            back to its source. He had been picking odd hours to make
            appearances lately, early in the morning when the streetlights were
            still on or later in the day, when the blacktop was beginning to
            cool. He wore a headband now, black, like he was protesting or
            grieving or something. My father was asleep and I was driving his
            car like it was my car, aimlessly, with the radio turned down.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pulled up next to him so that he was in between the gully and the
            car and although my window was rolled down, and I could have carried
            on a conversation with him if I just raised my voice, I didn't say a
            word. He didn't turn his head. He didn't even quicken his pace. I
            think if he had just said something, or stopped running, I would
            have gunned the engine and taken off, but no, he was determined.
            Although he looked like he was going to cry.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We're you headed?” I finally yelled. It was the best joke I could
            think of. I was drinking of can of Coke, and I picked at the tab and
            made a little plucking sound. The car was running really nice, as
            well as it had ever run, and I wondered if my father had worked on
            it or had someone work on it. If so, that made my problems worse if
            he found out I had taken it, which he probably would. “Hey,” I said.
            “Where you headed? Do you need a ride? I'm going to Texas. You can
            come along if you want.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was like talking back to a movie. It was like he was running a
            real race, and I was just a distraction, and he was going to win if
            it took everything in him. I glanced away from him and up ahead. The
            road split away from the ditch up there and headed into town and
            then back around to my neighborhood. He was going to continue to
            follow it up the hill to the boxboard. I said, “Why the hell are you
            running here anyway? This is probably the worst place to run in the
            whole town.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was like I wasn't even there. I revved the engine, but he didn't
            look. He just narrowed his eyes a little, and not even like he was
            angry, more like he was focusing on something, squinting at it
            because it was faraway. The road was veering away from the ditch
            now, splitting into a fork, and I was going to go right and he was
            going to go left. That's when I gave the wheel a sharp jerk. The car
            lurched to the left, right at Leslie, and he dropped out of sight
            like the earth had swallowed him up. I slammed on the brakes and
            looked over my shoulder.
          </p>
          <p>
            There he was. Not under my tires or even in the ditch, but rising to
            his feet amid a cloud of dust. I pushed the car into park and
            stepped out and I walked over to him. Blood was coming down his
            knees and he was covered with little pebbles and dirt. All that gunk
            stuck to him like glue because of all the sweat, and I think it made
            him look worse than he actually was, I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran over to him and put my hand on his back and for a split second
            I felt his lungs working as he took a deep breath. Then he was
            walking away from me, still following the ditch like he was an
            animal or something and he looked strong and weak at the same time,
            the way animals become when they're in pain. I knew that it was
            over, but I didn't want it to end, and I knew what was in store for
            me, because the car was almost as dirty as McKenzie now. It was
            almost completely dark, and I heard his feet scraping across the
            dirt as he headed up the hill, and I wanted to follow him wherever
            he was going.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There's nothing to talk about,” I told Beth. “Not really.” I had
            followed her into the kitchen, where she was rubbing circles in a
            plate. I said, “It wasn't a good trip, obviously. That's all. And
            then I bumped into that guy. And you and I had that stupid phone
            conversation.” I came up behind her with the intention of drying
            some of the dishes she was washing, but instead I put my hand on her
            back. I could feel her muscles moving as she washed the dish, her
            breath rising and falling. I said, “I think it's over between us,
            huh? After that phone call? I think that's just about it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You said that,” she said. “I didn't say that. It might be, but I'm
            not the one who said it. I'm not the one who wants it that way. Not
            really.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I took my hand from her back and wiped my face hard, across the
            eyes. “Jesus Christ,” I said. “I'm turning into a little girl. I
            can't stop crying. And the sun is out and everything. You'd don't
            need this. You must be up to your neck with this shit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, this is new,” she said, and she tried to smile. She pushed up
            against me and I closed my eyes and I could hear the water running
            down into the garbage disposal. I thought about how nice it would be
            to take a hot shower with her. We hadn't done that in a long time.
            There was something about spooning together after you showered,
            something virginal. I didn't want to have sex or even kiss her much.
            I just wanted to sleep with her, and wake up to a darkened house and
            make dinner together. I wanted to slip out of this moment and under
            a particular blanket I had seen folded up in the closet. Beth put
            her hand to my face and said, “Tell me.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The afternoon of my father's funeral, I called a moving company and
            asked them to lug everything in his house into storage. The realtor
            had told me how a furnished house sells more quickly, and that maybe
            I should even replace some of the shabbier items with new things,
            but I didn't care. The moving company said that they could have
            people over the next morning. It was like a burden had been lifted
            from my shoulders. It was like, lo and behold, the skies opened up
            and there was the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was doubly satisfied with myself, because this was exactly the
            kind of decisive action that Beth has criticized me for not doing in
            our relationship. She says that it's my instinct to run down into
            myself. She says that I don't take action during the critical
            moment. She says that I have an incredible gift for hiding. I had to
            fight the urge to call her and talk to her, tell her I love her and
            see if it surprised her, even confused her. I wondered if I could
            still surprise her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I decided that I was hungry. There were TV dinners in the
            freezer and I took one out and heated it up in the oven. I sat down
            at the table and I thought, this must be something like what he had
            been doing the day he died. The oven was making the little clicking
            sound it had made when I was a kid, like a stopwatch counting down.
            The silverware and plates and glasses were all in the same places.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doorbell rang while I was eating. It was the movers, three of
            them, looking like they had done this a trillion times before. They
            took a walk through the house to see what they were in for, looking
            over the stuff in the kitchen and living room and bedrooms. It
            struck me then how differently they saw everything than I did. They
            are looking at things according to their size and weight. Is the
            kitchen table going to fit through the doorway? How heavy is the
            couch?
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to tell them, that's the couch I sat in, and that's the
            chair he sat in, when we ate dinner and watched television. I wanted
            to tell them, you could build palaces out of the things we didn't
            say. Ridiculous, really. “I'm sure you guys can handle it,” I said,
            and I walked back into the kitchen to finish my food. I could hear
            them talking about a football game. One of them had lost some money
            and one of them had won some money. They were laughing about
            something as I picked up the phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It felt strange calling my number from my father's house, as if I
            were young again and calling some future version of myself. I half
            expected that future self to pick up the phone and say hello, it's
            me, your future self, which gives you some idea of my fucking state
            of mind, I guess. What could he have told me? A warning would have
            been nice. I would have appreciated it, and I would have told him
            something to the effect of, “Hey, don't worry about it, okay?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I heard Beth's voice say hello automatically, as if she was
            expecting a salesman or wrong number. The movers were still talking,
            and I pictured them sitting on the couch. In a second, they were
            going to click on the television or something.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Beth,” I said, in a half-whisper, like I was calling from jail. I
            walked over to the far side of the room, as far away from the movers
            as I could get and I said, “It's me.” Outside, there were birds
            pecking at a little stone bird bath, and I wondered when my father
            had bought it, and why he had bought it, and what the hell it meant
            that he would do such a thing.
          </p>
          <p>“It's me,” I said again.</p>
          <p>“Gary?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes,” I said, and then, “Oh, God, I'm sorry. I really am sorry
            about everything. I promise I'll make it up to you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            My teeth were clenched and I was still whispering. My throat felt as
            if I had swallowed something hard and doughy. My face was hot and my
            voice didn't even quite sound like my own, but I kept talking. “I'm
            being honest with you,” I said. “I really am. I believe in us. I
            want to work this out. I really do. I'm so sorry.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hey,” she said. “Hey.”</p>
          <p>“I'm sorry.”</p>
          <p>
            “Tell me about the funeral. What happened? Did something bad happen,
            Gary?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Something bad,” I said. “Something bad.” And I laughed. “I don't
            want a divorce,” I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I haven't asked for a divorce,” she said. “We haven't even talked
            about that.”
          </p>
          <p>“We will. We will.”</p>
          <p>
            She was quiet then, and I listened for the movers in the other room,
            but they weren't speaking anymore either. I swear to God, I could
            smell my father's breath on the damned phone. “You're the only
            person who understands me,” I whispered. The movers had come back
            inside and they were knocking some stuff around.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don't understand you,” she said, and I almost laughed again. I
            almost hung up. I listened to her breathing and I didn't know what
            to say.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'll be home soon,” I said. “There are just a few things to wrap-up
            here,” and there was like a little click in my head and it was like
            we were not talking even though she was still talking.
          </p>
          <p>“Tell me what's the matter,” she said.</p>
          <p>“We'll talk when I get home,” I said. “Now is a bad time.”</p>
          <p>
            I hung up the phone and paced around the house quickly, like I was
            walking off a sprain. Now that the rooms were on their way to being
            empty, the place seemed gigantic. Or I seemed smaller, maybe that
            was it. I stood in the living room and without the curtains on the
            windows I could see out into the neighborhood in all directions: out
            across the small lawn that was already overgrown, and at the houses
            on the other side of the street.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could see the neighbor to the left of us, who never got along with
            my father and who had probably moved to another town or was maybe
            dead too, which would have made my dad happy. I walked around the
            house some more, moving aimlessly from room to room. Upstairs,
            downstairs, then upstairs again. I guess I was looking for
            something, ridiculous as it sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found it in the cellar, although it wasn't what I expected. On the
            far side of the room, near the oil burner, there was an old bureau
            and some other junk not worth moving. It was painted with three
            different colors of paint, and had gashes across the front like
            someone had raked it with a crowbar, but seeing it maybe the absence
            of everything else seem more pronounced somehow, and I suddenly
            regretted moving the things out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not just regretted, either. It seemed like the most stupid thing I
            could have done, stupid in the way that animals are stupid, moving
            by instinct and emotion. I saw myself as something shadowy and
            slippery, something sliding out on the edges of my own perception.
            In that moment I seemed like both hunter and prey, which is a
            romantic and fucked-up way of looking at yourself, although also
            maybe true. I walked over to the deep double sink where my father
            used to clean his paintbrushes in the early evening. I turned the
            faucet so I could splash some water on my face, but no water came
            out.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's when I remembered the spigot just outside and the length of
            garden hose attached to it. The fact that I had forgotten about it
            seemed like more negligence, so I walked to the bulkhead door and
            opened it to go out into the yard. There were five steps leading up
            to the bulkhead doors, running across a small space almost big
            enough to be a small room. Embedded in the concrete floor behind the
            steps there was a small pump that whirled into action whenever it
            rained hard, saving the cellar from flooding. I remembered listening
            to it from my bedroom as a kid. It sounded like an airplane moving
            overhead, not something lodged in the ground down below me, but
            something circling the house. I suddenly wanted to tell Beth that
            story, and explain to her why it was important.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also remembered that my father had stored things in that little
            space-tools and rakes and things he didn't want me fucking with. The
            stairs were held in place by simple slots on either side of the
            wall, and they could be removed with a tug. I removed two of the
            stairs, set them against the wall, and climbed inside. It was damp
            and cool in there, and I decided it was a pretty good place to be on
            a hot summer's day. Sure enough, there was a set of metal shelves in
            there, and something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had not left letters or diaries or even photographs, but he had
            left something, and it seemed like as much a message to me as those
            other things would have been. It was a small handgun in a wooden
            slide-top box. I hadn't known he had even owned one. It looked like
            he had made the box for the gun. They fit together perfectly, and
            the corners of the box were sanded and cross-hatched delicately, the
            way I had seen him make a table. There was only one thing to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I slid the gun between my lips and tasted it, and I felt stronger
            than I had for a long time. Everything had been reduced to one
            simple decision, and the decision was mine to make. I could hear the
            mover's shambling around upstairs and I thought of them finding me
            down here. When I picked up the gun, I had known that I would not
            actually pull the trigger. I figured it did not have bullets in it
            either. I knew my father well enough to be sure about that.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was like a game I was playing. But now I wasn't so sure, because
            had I ever been sure about my father, really? But it was still a
            game, I guess. It didn't really mean anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movers were moving something heavy and cumbersome now, not
            lifting but sliding, sliding across my father's hard wood floors,
            and it was funny because I thought that I should complain to their
            boss. I could hear them giving directions to each other, and
            laughing again. One of them said, “Easy now. Easy now. Do you want
            me to put some grease on it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I pushed the barrel down on my tongue and then deeper, and then just
            like that I was vomiting down my arm, and then onto the floor when I
            crouched down to one knee, and then again when I walked over to the
            little toilet on the far side of the cellar. I held both sides of
            the dirty little bowl, stained with thirty years of my father's shit
            and piss, and I just let it all go.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gun was somewhere on the floor behind me. I would have to wash
            it off, and put it back in the box, and then do something with the
            box. Put it back. Get it away from me. I wouldn't check the barrel.
            Maybe I wouldn't even touch it again. It felt like I hadn't touched
            it at all, like it hadn't even existed, and that maybe I should just
            head upstairs right then and stop those guys before they did anymore
            damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey,” someone said. It was one of the movers. He had a lamp in his
            hand, and was halfway down the stairs. I turned my head away and
            wiped my face. “Are you all right?” he asked.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I saw him the day after I emptied out the house, in a mall of all
            places. I don't know why I was even there, except that it was only a
            year old and I wanted to be someplace without a history. I had a
            couple of bags of odds and ends with me—candy and some magazines a
            shirt from Sears and a hammer because I wanted to smack the boards
            down the cellar back in position. I was in a pretty good mood, if
            you can believe it, and I was looking forward to sitting on the
            floor of the empty living room that evening and eating the candy
            with the magazines spread around me. Naked girls and stuff like
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            But mainly I was thinking how funny it was that just the day before
            I had slid the barrel of a gun inside my mouth. My very own mouth!
            It seemed hard to believe, even for me, the only person who had
            actually experienced it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could almost still taste the metal and something else, something
            black and almost sooty, probably left over from the last time the
            gun was fired. And here I was walking out of a Sear's department
            store with a nice new shirt and a bag of those gourmet jelly beans
            that taste like one hundred million different flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was an old lady in front of me walking super slow, and
            baggy-pants clown-kids off to my right giving me the once-over, and
            I realized then that not a single person would ever-not ever-know
            about what had happened that afternoon two days before. It wouldn't
            even require an act of will on my part. It was like it had already
            been decided.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's when I saw Leslie McKenzie, and it was especially strange
            because he was not walking towards me. He was coming out of Sears
            too, walking abreast of me about fifteen feet over but almost
            exactly parallel to me. He had a bag too, and for a second it just
            all seemed too strange to be real.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was almost thin now, certainly thinner than me, except he had
            this weird little pot belly and a kind of sag in his cheeks and neck
            that seemed to be a holdover from the way he used to look. He was
            wearing glasses and a T-shirt and jeans, and he was kind of moving
            like he was in a hurry, like he had just remembered he had left the
            lights on in his Explorer. I glanced over at him and at first I
            thought, nah, no way, but then I stopped and looked closer. It was
            definitely him.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, hey,” I said. “This is strange.”</p>
          <p>
            He didn't stop or even look in my direction, but I could tell that
            he recognized me. How could he not? I looked almost exactly the same
            as I did a decade before, bar a few pounds and a receding hairline.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost said something else, but he was up ahead of me now, and I
            would have really yelled, and not just yelled, but yelled at his
            back, which seemed pretty stupid and kind of, I don't know, beneath
            me. I almost did it. To be honest, I kind of wish I had.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or even better, I just wish he had acknowledged me the very first
            time. That wouldn't have been very hard for him to do. I mean, it
            was definitely him.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know exactly what I would have said to him too. I would have said,
            “Hey, how are you, man?” And then, after we had talked for a little
            while I would have said, “Remember that time?” and of course I
            wouldn't even have to finish the sentence, because I'd see it in his
            face. He would remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'm sorry,” I'd say. “I'm very sorry.” Very calm and even, like I
            was a doctor reporting some illness that really had nothing to do
            with me. There would be an awkward silence then, but I'd say, “Hey,
            it couldn't have been too bad. You look like you're doing pretty
            good.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He would smile and say thanks and he'd lean forward and speak
            quietly, like he didn't want anyone to overhear us. This was
            something that was meant for only us two. Oh, it would have felt
            real fine for him to do something like that. I can picture it.
          </p>
          <p>
            He would tell me that he was doing better than pretty good, that he
            was great. He would talk to me about the good things in his life,
            right there and then, and how he hadn't been held back by all that
            other stuff, which was, after all, in the past, and maybe not really
            that bad at all. He would do all of this just standing there in the
            mall with people sliding by thinking we were talking about the
            weather or something. It wouldn't even take that long. Two minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then he would reach out to shake my hand, but my right hand would be
            holding the shopping bag, so I'd reach out with my left and we'd
            sort of clasp hands-not a handshake really, just an awkward touch,
            like my grandmother used to touch my hand when she slipped me money.
            He would smile and I would smile and we would let go and as he was
            letting go he'd see something in the way I was looking at him and
            he'd say, “Don't worry about it. It's okay.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It wouldn't have been too hard for him to just let me off the hook
            like that, you know? Just let me off the hook.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What do you mean?” Beth asks. We are in the bathroom. The shower is
            running and we're getting undressed. I'm looking at her jeans on the
            floor, and then at her naked thighs, then her face, because I'm
            sitting on the edge of the bathtub. She touches my shoulders. She
            pulls my T-Shirt off over my head. The room fills with steam.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It wouldn't have been too hard,” I tell her again, although I'm not
            sure she hears me, and I don't know where this is headed. I am
            thinking about my father again, facing me across our narrow living
            room. Could something as simple as words have saved him?
          </p>
          <p>“Listen,” I say, and I try to start over.</p>

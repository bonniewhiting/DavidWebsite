            A few weeks ago, while standing in the produce section of the new
            grocery store in Dexter, I noticed someone inspecting oranges the
            way my mother once did, turning them over one at a time in her hand,
            like a pitcher finding the threads of a baseball. It was not that
            this woman looked that much like my mother, although she was tall
            and thin. It was the way she moved-methodically, confidently—and the
            way she smiled slightly to herself, as if she were remembering
            something good that had once happened to her. I glanced behind her,
            expecting to find my father there, sullenly pushing the grocery
            cart.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last six years I've worked at a newspaper in Orono, covering
            school committee meetings in townships too small to support their
            own papers. About a third of my time on the job is spent driving.
            It's the only part of the job that I can say I truly enjoy, and it
            requires its own set of special skills, just the same as the writing
            and reporting. I'm good at it. I know where the police hide along
            the roads, so I can get away with speeding, and because I don't
            punch a clock, sometimes I simply disappear. I go for a walk, or
            read a newspaper in my car—whatever I want. That's what I was doing
            when I saw the woman in the grocery store—the woman who reminded me
            of my mother. I had a few hours free and I had decided to do some
            errands, and then there she was, and although she didn't see me, I
            felt like I had been caught, and I wanted to leave before she
            pivoted in my direction. Which is exactly what I did do, stranding
            my grocery cart in the aisle with a few items inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was not a logical reaction, of course. But the sighting
            possessed the strange logic dreams have, and as with a dream, I
            wanted to pass it on to someone else before it was forgotten. The
            only person who would have understood is my brother, though, and he
            would have pretended he didn't understand at all-he would have just
            laughed and said, “Cheryl, you think too much.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I left home at eighteen, for reasons I'm still sorting out, and
            worked odd-jobs around the east coast for a few years, first in
            southern New Hampshire; then in New Brunswick, New Jersey; and then
            in Lowell, Massachusetts, where I accumulated enough cash and
            motivation to go to school. My brother Robert was fourteen when I
            left home, eighteen when I saw him again—the same age I had been
            when I first left. I didn't talk to my parents or brother much
            during those four years, and there was a sense—despite my mother's
            occasional phone calls—that one more move might separate us
            completely. But in the winter of my second and last year in college,
            I decided that I would return to Maine and visit them. Part of my
            life was ending and a new part beginning, and I guess I thought my
            family might help me through the transition. I suppose I was
            motivated by affection, obligation and maybe morbid curiosity, which
            is another way of saying I was confused, a mindset I often found
            myself in then.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weather was bad the night of my return, and it grew even worse
            during the half hour I waited near baggage claim, watching out the
            window for a sign of my brother. “It's the damned snow,” he said as
            an explanation for his lateness, and he looked out the row of
            darkened windows at the fat snowflakes falling onto the airport
            parking lot, as if they needed to be pointed out to me, so that I
            wouldn't see his excuse as flimsy. Then he seemed to remember
            something. He smiled. “How are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “A little tired,” I said. He wore what looked like new boots and an
            unbuttoned dungaree jacket. One of the knees of his jeans had been
            torn out and I could see the gray-white of his thermal underwear
            through the hole. He lifted my shoulder bag into the trunk of his
            car and then we stood facing each other. His hair had been cut too
            close to his head, so that I could see his scalp. “We better get
            going,” I said. “It's only going to get worse.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We didn't talk much on that thirty minute drive out to the house. I
            remember thinking that he must be concentrating on his driving. The
            wind had picked up and the snow seemed to chase us down the road,
            spiraling behind the car in a kind of tunnel. “What have you been up
            to?” I finally asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, you know,” he said, “same-old, same-old.” He looked away from
            the road and met my eyes. “I'm wondering something,” he said. I
            watched the shallow ruts where other cars had driven recently. Snow
            floated and swirled in the headlight glow. “I'm wondering why you
            decided to come back.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Did he mean to say that he thought I shouldn't have come back, that
            he wouldn't have remained if he could have helped it? Did he mean to
            say that he didn't want to see me, that he was angry for some
            reason? I gave the knee-jerk answer. “To see you and dad and mom, of
            course.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He grunted in reply and turned the windshield wipers to high. I
            thought about how I had changed, gained a little weight, cut my hair
            too. A new pocketbook rested on my lap, and in it there was a few
            hundred dollars wrapped in a rubber band, some lipstick, too many
            pictures of an ex-boyfriend, and half a pack of cigarettes. It felt
            like I had a lot of secrets in there, although I guess that wasn't
            true. “Remember when dad used to take us sledding when we were
            kids?” Robert said, with a glance over at me.
          </p>
          <p>“No,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Neither do I,” he said, “but he does.”</p>
          <p>
            My mother had shared many details of their lives during our phone
            conversations. I knew Robert had found work at a garage, first
            pumping gas, then helping out on the cars. My father had bought two
            dogs, pure-breeds, but sold them after a few weeks when their
            barking kept him up at night. Certain people I had dated in high
            school married and settled in town. Other people—she called them my
            friends, I called them acquaintances—moved away. My father built a
            screened-in porch on the east side of the house. Sitting in the car
            with Robert, all of these facts seemed insufficient. It wasn't that
            I thought my mother had kept something from me. She was one of the
            few people I knew who seemed incapable of deceit. But I also knew
            she had the ability to ignore things. Looking on the bright side,
            she called it. I think it was this trait which contributed most to
            my parents' marriage lasting as long as it did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, as we turned onto the stretch of narrow access road that
            cuts through the woods to the house, Robert looked at me. “He's not
            like you remember him,” he said.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I don't know what my father felt about the life he tried to make for
            us. He was not the kind of man who talked about his past. That job
            fell to my mother, and she conducted it discreetly, the way she
            carried out most of her responsibilities. Sometimes, when Robert and
            I were upset with him, she would take us aside and talk about the
            house as a gift my father had given us. “You can't imagine how hard
            he worked on this place,” she would say, when she had found me in
            whatever room I was hiding in, and then I would feel sorry about
            whatever I had done to make him raise his voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can imagine him back then as a pretty impressive figure—in his
            late twenties, a good seven or eight years older than my mother. He
            had inherited land in Maine from an uncle, and for more than two
            years he drove up there from Revere, Massachusetts with friends on
            Fridays after work, where they set up tents, drank, and worked on
            the house, sometimes late into the night. Then they lay sleeping
            bags on the unfinished floors and slept, rolled them up on Sunday
            and drove back home. My mother said he often changed his clothes,
            showered and had dinner at her parents' house when he returned from
            those weekends. He told them what he had accomplished—putting up
            sheetrock in the bedroom, painting a final skim coat, setting down
            flagstone rag work from the front door to the driveway—as if he was
            laying the future out on the table for everyone to see. His head
            must have been full of all kinds of plans he had never been able to
            act on until then, when the land and my mother both happened into
            what must have previously been a frustrating life.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was an amateur carpenter, and friendly, and these two things
            helped him get all sorts of inexpensive cull—bargain-priced
            two-by-fours, piping, bricks. He built up debts along with the
            house, especially for electric and plumbing, which he contracted
            out, although these hardships, my mother explained, were nothing
            insurmountable to a couple of strong young people, especially when
            land in interior Maine was a cheap investment. I think she drew as
            much solace from these stories as we did. She talked about that time
            as if it were a fairy tale, but of course I was a young girl then,
            and every story was told to me as if it were a fairy tale.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Remember those stories she used to tell about him?” I asked Robert,
            as we drove slowly up the access road. The car's headlights moved
            across the trees and then the house. We had arrived.
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah,” he said, but I wasn't sure if he was listening.</p>
          <p>
            Although the porch had been finished, it hadn't been painted. It was
            good-sized though, at least twenty feet square, with rows of
            jalousie windows. The addition gave the house an off-balanced
            appearance, and instead of making the whole appear larger, it drew
            attention to the smallness of the rest of the place. Robert dropped
            me off and told me he was heading out to his girlfriend's place,
            that he would see me that night or the next morning. I watched the
            car make a sloppy three-point turn and head back out where it had
            come from. No one came out to meet me. The only light glowed from
            the cellar. It looked as if nobody was home, or that my parents had
            gone to bed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just behind the house I found four thick posts in the ground with
            chicken wire stretched around them: my father's dog kennel. The
            farthest side had a window-sized circular hole near the bottom, a
            flat board next to that. It was like my father come up with an idea
            and not follow it through, then leave the evidence lying around. At
            least that was the father I knew—not the man who had built the
            house, but the man who had driven these four posts into the ground
            one Saturday on a whim. I wondered what had happened to the dogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I knocked at the side door, nobody answered, so I tried the
            knob. It was open, and I kicked off my shoes before going in,
            heading down the stairs, moving in the dark. I had expected the
            basement to smell like the rest of the house—my father's cigarettes
            mingled with my mother's cleaning products—lemon-scented soaps, wood
            oils and aromatic sprays. But the room smelt heavily of smoke and
            dampness.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father was sitting in his easy chair watching television with the
            sound off. When I told him that Robert had dropped me off and gone
            to see his girlfriend, he laughed and said, “Really? Which one?” He
            had gained some more weight, lost more hair, but overall he looked
            healthy, and more or less the way I remembered him. He waved his
            cigarette at the television, making circles in the air, as if he
            were waving a wand. “Would you mind straightening that antenna?” A
            scotch and ice rested next to him on the arm of the chair, the ice
            something new for him. “Your mother's in bed. She wanted to stay up,
            but she has a cold, and she was practically falling asleep standing
            up. I told her no martyrs.” He shook the ice around in his glass.
            “Want anything to drink?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, thank you,” I said. I swept ashes and wrappers into my palm,
            looked around for a trash can. “Let me clean this up.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Jesus, Cheryl,” he said, “if you want to make yourself useful,
            start by filling this back up.” He held out his empty glass. “And
            you can get one for yourself.” He crushed some ice between his
            teeth. His smile spread wider. He winked at me. “Damn, it's good to
            see you.” His general attitude made it seem as if he had just told
            me a secret, the wink his acknowledgement that I would not tell.
            Maybe sharing a drink with him would have been that secret.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pool table sat flush against the far wall, the brown-green top
            covered by pale chalk dust and a couple of stray car odds and ends,
            an old muffler, a car battery. Something orange had been spilled on
            the couch. “When's Mom going to clean this place up?” I asked him. I
            set down my purse, lifted a spark plug off the table, and turned it
            over in my fingers.
          </p>
          <p>
            He laughed. “Your mother? I don't let her in here.” He held out the
            glass for me to receive, fill and then return to him. “This is my
            private room, you know? My special boys-only clubhouse, I guess you
            could call it. Which means I must really love you to let you in
            here, into my I'm-fucking-fed-up-and-want-to-be-alone room.” He
            jingled the glass. “Oh, waitress.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I could picture my mother moving softly around the rest of the
            house, almost floating, moving this vase, dusting that table, then
            disappearing into another room, like a spirit. But she would always
            stop at the threshold of this room and turn back, because my father
            had said so. I set down the plug and tried to change the subject.
            “What's up with Robert?”
          </p>
          <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
          <p>I rubbed my head. “You know. Everything. His hair.”</p>
          <p>
            He ground his cigarette out, still holding his glass with the other
            hand. “Robert's full of ideas, about traveling, about the army and
            the air force. He wants to enlist and I guess the haircut's part of
            that. You should see his room. All posters of fighter planes and
            guns.” He moved forward in his chair, closer. “But you know what? He
            doesn't really want to. He just wants me to think he's going to.” He
            stopped smiling, and he seemed older all of a sudden. I could see
            the lines at the side of his mouth and across his forehead as he
            concentrated on what he was saying. “He's not like you, Cheryl. He's
            all over the place. I got him that job at the station and every day
            he talks about quitting. And every day I tell him, 'If you quit that
            job, you're out of this house.'” The smile came back, wide as ever,
            and he laughed loud enough that I found myself smiling too. “You
            should hear us. Either I'm going to break his neck one of these days
            or he's going to break mine.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He was caught in that state between complete drunkenness and sober
            lucidity; one more drink and he might be yelling angrily about
            something, two and he'd be asleep, but right then, with the empty
            glass in his hand, his words were almost meditative. “He's not like
            you in that way either. I raise my voice to him and it scares him a
            little. That never worked with you.”
          </p>
          <p>“Water under the bridge,” I said.</p>
          <p>
            “I'm glad to hear you say that, Cheryl. That's exactly how I feel.”
          </p>
          <p>I looked to the doorway. “What room am I sleeping in?”</p>
          <p>“Life's too short,” he said.</p>
          <p>“Dad,” I said, more forcefully.</p>
          <p>
            “You know, there's work to be found around here,” he said, looking
            straight ahead at the television. “You know that.” I walked across
            the room and took his bottle off the pool table. I handed it to him
            and watched him pour, the tip of the bottle tapping the edge of the
            glass, then took the bottle back. I screwed the cap on and set it
            near his chair. “Thanks,” he said, “I knew you couldn't hold out
            forever.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The fold-out sofa upstairs was made up with fresh sheets. On the
            pillow I found a note written in my mother's wide-looped
            handwriting. “Cheryl. Hope you had a good flight. Your father's
            watching television in his cage, but he'll be asleep by the time you
            get in. Turn off the television if you happen to wander by. Come and
            wake me and we'll talk.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            This is my favorite part. I've just left the office after meeting my
            deadline, which is about eleven o'clock, since it's an afternoon
            paper. The roads are empty and I'm hovering in that moment between
            having just completed something and having to complete the next
            thing. There's a city council meeting that night, so I have time to
            kill. I stop for an Italian Ice at a roadside Ice Cream stand. Not a
            single person knows where I am or even cares to know. I could drive
            to Bangor and see a matinee movie, or head somewhere for a long,
            sprawling lunch, but I decide to stay right there.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as this moment is happening, as it's sort of unfolding, it's
            also unhappening. It's moving away from me, and I'm looking out
            ahead of it, when I'll be sitting in my usual folding chair at the
            city council meeting, writing my usual notes, or even when I'm home
            that night, brushing my teeth and spitting into the sink. Would it
            be stupid to say that I miss that little nothing moment as it's
            happening, that I'm already pining a little? I guess it would, but
            these were always valuable to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a child, I loved rare moments of peace and quiet, when the world
            seemed to have stopped. Since my father worked construction, the
            money came in more or less seasonally, and winters were especially
            hard on all of us—on our mother because that was when she went to
            work at Sears part-time, and I think my father expected her to still
            complete all the housework while working twenty hours a week; on my
            father too, because he felt guilty and inadequate. He didn't tell me
            this but I knew he must have felt it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I say this, I don't mean to place blame on one person. All I
            mean is that this type of winter was difficult, and I think we would
            have done just about anything to avoid it. My father worked as much
            overtime as he could during the summer, sometimes to the point where
            he all but vanished from our lives. My mother babysat the children
            of nearby families, kids who called her by her first name. They sold
            off two acres of land and used some of the money to fill the oil
            burner. Robert and I even gathered together my father's beer bottles
            and cashed them in at a liquor store in town.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was during these winters that my mother sometimes left the house
            and headed to her sister's apartment back in Methuen. “I'm going on
            one of my vacations,” she would say, and then the suitcases would
            make their appearance in the front hall, and the next day our aunt
            would appear in her blue Impala, idling at the side of the house
            while my mother said her good-byes. I remember watching from the
            window as she her carried her suitcases, one in each hand, my
            father, barefoot and coatless in the snow, yelling something at her
            back. Eventually my father came inside, his face and arms red from
            cold. I'll always remember what he said to me then. He said, “Don't
            forget that your mother didn't just leave me. She left you and she
            left Robert. She left all three of us. You keep that in mind.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While she was gone from the house, I sometimes talked to her at the
            Sears jewelry counter or at her sister's apartment. She took my hand
            and said things like “It's tough on Robert and you, I know.” But
            then a customer would come in or her sister would bring something to
            eat out of the kitchen or my mother would just change the subject.
            Eventually, she would return, and we'd stay up late eating and
            telling stories. My father would make jokes we didn't understand,
            but we'd all laugh anyway, and my mother would talk about how
            difficult a person her sister was, and how glad she was to be back.
            “The house looks a little wild,” she'd say, looking around, “but I
            kind of counted on that. I would have been hurt if it had been
            otherwise.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought about her small escapes when I made my own at eighteen,
            and her returns when I made my way back that Winter. The morning
            after my plane ride into Maine, I woke to hear her in the kitchen,
            the gentle clatter of silverware being sorted into a drawer. It was
            still snowing, and the horizon was hazy, but I could see the tree
            line where our land became state property from the window. I
            wondered if my father was planning to sell off a few more acres.
            There were another five acres behind the house. I pictured him as a
            man on an island with the tide coming in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Downstairs, Robert stood at the living room window, watching
            something. I came over and watched too. It was my father. He wore a
            green army parka, the color of a faded dollar bill. He had pulled
            the hood up and zipped the front of the jacket to his neck, so all I
            could see was his nose and eyes, and those not very well. He had a
            sled in his hands, one of those plastic disks kids use, and was
            loading it into the back of the truck. “He wants the two of us to go
            up on the hill with him,” Robert said. “He just put an inner tube
            and a toboggan in the truck too.”
          </p>
          <p>I smiled. “Sounds like fun.”</p>
          <p>
            “Not in this weather,” he said. “In this weather, it's just a pain
            in the ass.” He put his hand gently against the window and said,
            “I'm going to tell you something they don't want you to know.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The wind hadn't died down from the night before, and the snow
            slanted out of the sky, which had grown white with diluted sunshine.
            I could feel the cold through the window, and if I had placed my
            fingers against the glass—at the point where Robert's hand rested—I
            probably would have felt the pane shudder. My father was having a
            difficult time moving through these gusts; he held his arm just
            above his face and looked at his feet as he walked. A snow drift
            piled against the truck had managed to cover the front driver's side
            tire. Other parts of the ground had been blown almost bare—just a
            thin layer of ice and snow. Robert said, “He thinks he's going to
            die soon, Cheryl. Why do you think mom was bugging you so much to
            come back?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “She wasn't bugging me, Robert,” and I felt stupid for saying it,
            for saying anything, when what I should have been doing was
            listening.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah, well,” he said, and he laughed again, a small noise,
            resigned, as if he were chuckling at some joke he had heard before,
            and then he bent down and slid a razor across the sole of one of his
            boots, making deep cross-hatches. “What's that?” I asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Traction.”</p>
          <p>“No. The laugh.”</p>
          <p>
            “Just like mom,” he said. He was ignoring me now, and I turned to
            the kitchen door.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mother's hands were deep in the sink, her back to me. Her hair
            was still mostly dark, although I noticed thick strands of dignified
            gray. Other than that she appeared almost unchanged. She was still
            shapelessly thin—boyish, I guess—and taller than me, almost my
            father's height. “I'm mad at you,” she said, as she turned around.
            “You didn't wake me up last night when you got in.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, you didn't wake me up this morning,” I said. “What time is
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She smiled and looked me over. “Come here,” she said, and pulled me
            close for a brief hug.
          </p>
          <p>“Is dad okay?” I asked.</p>
          <p>
            She folded her towel and looped it through one of the handles on the
            cupboards. “Your father is like one of those tour guides who has to
            keep things moving all the time. That's his pace.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That's not what I mean,” I said. That had always been my mother's
            method of dealing with him, using her generosity of spirit as a kind
            of concealment. It was almost heartening to see it in action again.
          </p>
          <p>“He's fine,” she said. “Everything's okay.”</p>
          <p>
            “I think he asked me to move back here last night when we were
            talking.”
          </p>
          <p>“You can't listen to him when he's that way. You know that.”</p>
          <p>“I know. But he seemed serious.”</p>
          <p>“He's never serious. Especially not lately.”</p>
          <p>
            The door in the other room opened and I could hear Robert and my
            father talking. I softened my voice to a whisper. “He was last
            night.”
          </p>
          <p>“Don't get upset.”</p>
          <p>
            “I'm not upset. I'm not upset at all. But you lied to me.” I caught
            myself raising my voice again and took a deep breath. “You're lying
            to me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I didn't lie to you. Everything's fine.” I opened my mouth to say
            something—I'm not sure I knew what—but she pulled me a little closer
            and spoke into my ear. “It's just a little problem with his kidney,
            but he's going to dialysis. He's on some waiting lists. It's going
            to be fine.” She let that settle in, and when she continued, she had
            changed the subject. She let go of my arm, although she still held
            me with a hard look. “When he asked you that last night, about
            moving back, what did you tell him?”
          </p>
          <p>
            That's when Robert interrupted to tell me my father was waiting in
            the truck, and that we should get going.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was easy to see that my mother's life was difficult, and that my
            being there might make things more manageable. For the first time
            since I had left I thought of myself living under that roof, not
            just staying there for two or three days, but living there as a part
            of a family again. I could see the deliberate habits I had built up
            acting as counter-balance to my father's moods. My composure might
            offset Robert's anger, and I could probably bolster my mother when
            she wavered. Dad would get better. Things would be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the time it took to reach the driveway, I had dismissed the idea.
            That's her way of thinking, I told myself.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The three of us traveled thigh-to-thigh in the truck cab, my father
            driving, Robert at the other window, and me between them. When we
            arrived at the hill, he pulled up into a turnaround driveway used by
            maintenance people, parking as close as he could to the footpath
            that wound up through the woods to the top of the hill. He nodded at
            a thermos at my feet. I twisted the cap off and sniffed the familiar
            rum smell. He had a drink, and then he pulled his hood up over his
            head and stepped outside. “He seems okay,” I said to Robert, and
            then, “What are your plans?”
          </p>
          <p>He shrugged. “I don't know.”</p>
          <p>
            My father rapped his knuckles against the driver's side window.
            “Hurry up,” I heard him shout, or something like that. Robert
            slipped on a ski mask, so that I could only see his lips and eyes.
            Then he stepped out into what by this time had become a genuine
            blizzard. I noticed he had left another ski mask on the seat for me,
            and I rolled it up and put it on like a hat. When I stepped from the
            truck, my boots slipped deep into a snowdrift. Maybe it was the
            shock of the cold, but for the first time that day I was afraid. I
            could hear Robert's voice off to my right, cursing the weather or my
            father or both, and something metal shaking in the distance, and I
            did not understand how I had come to be there.
          </p>
          <p>
            We moved up the hill, our feet tilted a little sideways for
            traction. We marched in the same order we had sat in the truck, my
            father ahead of us by at least fifteen paces. He dragged three sleds
            behind him on ropes. By the time we got to the top, he had slipped
            open his jacket and was taking a drink from a plastic bottle. He
            smiled through the bits of snow in his beard. The wind made it
            difficult to hear, so the three of us didn't say a word. We just
            stood in a triangle, looking down the hill, the stretch of trees,
            the road beyond that. Twigs and bare branches stuck out of the white
            like skeleton hands. My father leaned forward, holding both of us by
            the shoulders and pulling us down toward him on either side, a
            quarterback in a huddle. “Who's first?” he said. He was grinning. It
            was hard to think of him as a sick man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert picked up his sled, a red plastic wedge, and walked away from
            us, lifting his legs at the knee. After seven or eight steps he
            dropped the sled. The wind caught it like a kite, and it skidded
            away. He stepped after it while my father laughed. He finally caught
            it by a tree, shouted something, and then began his walk back to the
            edge of the hill. I looked at my father, the expression on his face.
            He grinned and clapped his hands together twice when Robert grabbed
            the sled. His eyes widened when Robert almost fell, but when Robert
            recovered his balance, he smiled again. He seemed proud of my
            brother, as if Robert were a baby learning to walk. Robert sat
            cross-legged on the sled, pushing himself with his hands, lurching
            forward a foot at a time. I looked again at my father, who was
            zipping up his jacket. When I looked back Robert was gone. I
            followed the line of the hill to an inlet of trees, expecting to
            find him there. Nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father had picked up his own sled, an under-inflated black inner
            tube. He stepped once, steadied himself, then took another step. In
            this way he proceeded to a tree, which he gripped for balance while
            lowering himself into the tube. He pushed off and skimmed into the
            white dust, fading into the storm the way Robert had. It was my turn
            now. I nestled the runners of the sled in the snow, moving it back
            and forth. Then I pushed off, and ice spattered up in front of me.
            The nose of the sled rose up in the air, then slammed hard against
            the ground. My teeth closed on my tongue and I felt a rush of warmth
            in my mouth. I reached the steepest part of the hill, and I tried to
            hold on, although not well enough. The sled skidded ahead of me and
            I sprawled flat on my stomach, snow down the front of my jacket.
          </p>
          <p>
            I rolled over, breathing hard, and I lay there, looking straight up,
            a dull ache across the back of my neck. The snow cascaded down in
            large flakes, melting on my face. I couldn't see the sky, or any
            clouds, just snow falling. It had been a long time since I had seen
            a blizzard from that perspective, and for a second it seemed as if I
            were moving upward through the snowfall. The sky revolved above me.
            I thought, just stay here, but instead I sat up, cleared my throat,
            and spat. A red stain formed on the ground, vanishing as the snow
            covered it. I spat again, counted to two, and watched it disappear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rising to my feet, groaning, I looked around for the truck or Robert
            or my father. The top of the hill had vanished, or rather the top of
            hill had remained and I had vanished, absorbed into the weather. I
            sucked on my tongue and felt my mouth fill with warmth again, as if
            I had just taken a gulp of my mother's coffee. I spat, counted,
            “One, two,” and the blood was gone. A vague movement flickered in
            the cloud of snow. I stepped toward it. The shape moved closer, grew
            more defined. It was Robert. He held his sled like a shield.
          </p>
          <p>
            We didn't look at each other—lifting our heads would have speckled
            our faces with snow—but we knew what had to be done. Robert sliced
            his sled into the ground, covering it at the base so it wouldn't
            blow away—a marker. We turned our backs to each other and walked in
            opposite directions. After fifty or so yards I heard Robert yelling.
            I turned around, retracing my half-covered steps back to the sled,
            then further in Robert's direction. I found him, kneeling just past
            a group of trees and looking out into the clear field. My father was
            stretched out there on the ground, arms and legs thrown wide, as if
            he were making a snow angel. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the
            inner tube skid slowly into the patch of trees. Robert reached him
            first, put his arm around his neck and lifted him into a sitting
            position. “I'm not sure if you should do that,” I said, coming up
            behind him.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father kept saying, “I'm fine. I'm fine,” which made a good case
            for him being injured. “What hurts?” I asked.
          </p>
          <p>He folded his arms across his chest. “Nothing hurts.”</p>
          <p>“You might have broken something.”</p>
          <p>
            “Nothing's broken,” he said, and he grabbed my shoulder, lifting
            himself. His hood was thrown back, and his beard and eyelashes were
            caked with ice, his features partially hidden, distorted.
          </p>
          <p>
            He fell, rolling onto his side and hollering. For a second I thought
            he was joking, but he didn't get back up. Robert leaned over and
            looked at his foot, more to avoid his eyes, I thought, than to
            actually find out the extent of the damage. My father kept talking.
            “I'm perfectly all right.” I held out my hand, but he knocked it
            away with a wild sweep. I held it out again and he batted it away,
            so hard that my mitten slipped off. I picked up the mitten, shook
            it, and slipped it on. It was full of snow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert had stepped back and was watching us, wondering what he
            should do, I guess. I held out my left hand this time, but my father
            looked away, as if he had been offered something repugnant. “I can
            do it myself,” he said, but he didn't make an attempt. I stood
            there, kicking at snow until I saw specks of frozen dirt. “Give me a
            minute to catch my breath,” he said. If anything, it was beginning
            to snow harder. At least it seemed that way.
          </p>
          <p>“I think the truck's just a little ways in that direction.”</p>
          <p>He winced. “For Christ's sake, stop your badgering.”</p>
          <p>
            Robert stepped forward. “We're tired,” he said, and he closed his
            hand slowly around my father's. He didn't grab it really, the way
            someone might catch a baseball. He just extended his arm and
            enclosed his fingers around the palm. He tugged, not hard. “Come on.
            We're sick of this.” I could tell my father was seeing how much he
            could pull away from the grip without actually looking like he was
            expending the effort. Robert's hand was the smaller of the two, but
            his grip held. He pulled harder. I thought I should say something.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mitten came off in Robert's hand, and my father fell backwards.
            His shoulder hit the ground. At first I thought he might be hurt,
            but he sat up and wiped snow from his pants. “Oh, that was smart,”
            he said. “That was really smart.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert threw the mitten away. He gripped my father's hand again, at
            the wrist. “Hurry up.” He dragged him in the snow for a few feet,
            then stopped, hands on his hips, breathing hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father quickly pulled his hand to his chest. It seemed to fold
            inward there, curled like a question mark. His face was deep red,
            almost purple, around his thick cheeks. “You little shit,” he said.
            “Don't think I'm going to forget this.” He stopped, maybe waiting
            for Robert to yell something back, but Robert didn't say a thing. He
            kept going, his anger slurring the words. “Don't expect to have a
            place to sleep tonight. Not under my roof.” Robert looked up the
            hill, then out toward the main road. “And that little job you have,
            who do you think owns that place? One of my best friends, that's
            who, prick.” He sputtered, looking at the ground. “You prick.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert grabbed him by the collar and pushed him back. “You better
            get up,” he said. I knew I should intervene, push Robert away, but I
            didn't. Robert kept his hold on the collar and hit him on the back
            with his free hand. Then again. They were small punches, glancing
            slaps against the bulk of my father's coat. The sound reminded me of
            my mother beating blankets on the clothesline. My father twisted so
            that his back protected him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert punched him again, in the shoulder. He fell onto his side and
            yelled something I didn't hear, maybe not even a word, just a sound.
            For a second I thought he was going to stand and knock Robert down,
            but that was impossible. He was an old man, huddled at Robert's
            feet. Then he said, “Don't just stand there, Cheryl. Pull him off of
            me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither Robert nor I moved, although Robert's hand hung above my
            father's back, as if he were getting ready to hit him again. My
            father coughed. “Cheryl, for Christ's sake, are you just going to
            stand there and watch this?” His voice grew louder, more shrill. “I
            was right to kick your ass out. I always knew you didn't give a shit
            about anyone but yourself. I knew it.” He coughed again. “I knew
            it.” He said more, but I wasn't listening, because that's when I
            took a step, as if I suddenly remembered I could move.
          </p>
          <p>
            To tell the truth, I thought I was going to help him, offer him my
            hand again—he would take it now—or calm Robert down. That's why I
            leaned over him, I think, to help. But I didn't do that. I struck
            him too, in the small of his back. It must have hurt a little, I
            think, even through my mitten and his jacket. I felt it, anyway, on
            my knuckles. Robert slapped him on the back of the head. I threw
            another punch, then a third. When we stopped, I kicked some snow at
            him with the side of my boot.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've thought about that, the kick, the three punches. Of course, I
            did it to hurt him, and I'm sorry about that. But I think I also did
            it because I had to. I knew when I landed that first punch, and
            maybe even before that, when I took a step toward him, that there
            wouldn't be any room for compromise anymore. It was a decision I
            thought was irrevocable, and that's exactly what I wanted then—to go
            back to Massachusetts and start a new life in which I did not have
            to worry about my father, my brother, and even my mother.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the hospital I spoke to an intern. He was obviously tired, with
            narrow, slumped shoulders and reddened eyes. “What were you doing
            out?” he asked. The question seemed almost rhetorical. No answer
            would have been sufficient, so I didn't give him one. Neither did
            Robert or my father, who sat on the bed, jeans rolled halfway up his
            calf. He clutched his hand, massaging his fingers as the intern
            indicated the X-rays. “He has a fracture here, of the tibia, and
            here, of the fibula.” He flipped through several more X-rays of the
            ankle, always indicating the two broken areas. His gestures seemed
            rehearsed, scripted. So did our attentiveness. When he was finished
            he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He spoke very slowly
            and carefully. “We're going to put what we call a Jones Compression
            Dressing on his foot. When we're finished with that you should bring
            your father home, get some food in his stomach, and put him to bed.”
            It occurred to me then that each of us, including the intern, had
            his own reasons for wanting to get this over with as soon as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time we got to the house it had stopped snowing, and the
            world had that smooth, clean look it only has for a few hours after
            a heavy blizzard, before cars and plows and kids scratch at the
            surface of it. My father sat in the truck with the door open,
            crutches in his hands, while Robert and I shoveled the steps to the
            porch. I didn't think anything of it then, but he was already
            getting some of the color in his face back, and that slight swagger
            in his attitude. It was apparent in the way he dangled his bad foot
            out of the truck cab, impatiently waiting for Robert and me to
            finish, and in the way he drank from the thermos. Later in the day I
            would find it, empty, on the floor of the truck.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we finished shoveling a narrow path from the steps to the
            truck, we walked along with him, one of us on either side. “Look out
            for that patch of ice,” I said, pointing at the place where he had
            just positioned his crutch. He moved to the left, found a clear spot
            where he could see the black tar of the driveway, then took a
            hesitant step. “There you go,” I said. When he reached the stairs,
            Robert and I put our hands under his arms and helped him up to the
            first landing. After that, when it was clear he could do it himself,
            we let go of him, although our hands hovered inches from his back,
            almost touching him, just in case he should slip. Robert held the
            screen door. I moved the afghan throw rug. My father hobbled into
            the house.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert put the rug back in its place. He leaned his shovel against
            the wall. “I thought it would feel different.” I didn't say
            anything; maybe I was still confused by what had happened. I handed
            him my shovel and he put it with his. “I thought it would make me
            feel better, you know?”
          </p>
          <p>“It's okay,” I said.</p>
          <p>
            “I'm going to live here all my life,” he said, and his voice broke.
            “I know it. Dad is going to die and then I'll become him. I felt
            that today when I was standing over him. That's why I hit him the
            second time. That's why I couldn't stop hitting him.” His voice was
            soft and dull, but his eyes were red. The sun had reached its
            height, and drops of water were already dripping from around the
            gutters. By tonight they'd be icicles. Our winter clothes were
            strewn around the room, coats on furniture, boots tilted on their
            sides, small puddles of melting snow around them. My mother was in
            the other room, pouring my father tea. “The damned sled turned over,
            and I just fell wrong,” he explained as we came into the room, and
            she patted his hand and stood up as we sat down. She brought out
            sandwiches, and we ate in silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father did not die that year or the next or even the next. He
            lived there a long time, in that house. And Robert did not become my
            father, at least not in the way he expected—in the way he thought he
            might that day on the snow. He lost his job that spring and joined
            the army, but left that after about half a year with a dishonorable
            discharge. He headed to the southwest next—New Mexico, I think—and
            then Utah. It was difficult to picture my parents alone in that
            house after he left. Sometimes I talked to her on the phone and
            asked, “Mom, how are you doing, really?” And she would say something
            like, “Cheryl, I'm fine,” and she'd chuckle at my ridiculous
            question. I did not talk to my father during this time, except
            through my mother, and there seemed to be something insubstantial
            about him, as if he were just one of my mother's anecdotes. I began
            to expect the phone call telling me that he was gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years later, it was my mother who passed away in her sleep, and
            I returned again, for the funeral, and I ended up staying for more
            than a year. I had lost my job two months before, and someone needed
            to take care of my father, who didn't work at all anymore. Was it a
            favor I did for my mother or for him? I'm not sure. I think that
            during that time taking care of him, I had never been closer to my
            mother, although she was gone, of course. What I mean is that I
            found myself doing the things she did—cooking for him, spending my
            evenings alone while he shut himself away downstairs.

            It took two strokes to kill him, one while he walked through the
            yard, and another, three weeks later, while he slept in his chair in
            the cellar. I sometimes notice certain kind of men—very old men with
            knots of muscle in their shoulders and hard, round bellies. I stand
            behind them in the check out line of the grocery store as the clerk
            rings up their beer and lottery tickets, or I walk past them as they
            sit on park benches. I sometimes talk briefly to them when writing
            general interest stories about new hockey rinks or the latest
            election. These are men who might have been my father's friends, who
            are the right age, the right build, who just have that look about
            them. I write their words down in my notebook and I smile at them
            and sometimes they smile back and I think, he would have looked
            something like this.

            There is a gravity that surrounds places and people, something
            invisible that holds us to them. When I am driving home after work,
            I sometimes think of my mother driving down that same road for the
            first time, and what she might have thought when the house—the house
            I live in now—slid into view from behind the trees. It's like I know
            her then, like her anger is my anger. It's like that morning on the
            hill with my father, and my hands tighten on the steering wheel. But
            then the moment is unspooling as it spools, and as my hands turn the
            wheel I know it's only my anger I'm feeling.

        <h4>
          <strong>200 Kinds of Poison</strong> in <strong>Boulevard</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          You notice things the first time you enter a strange house: the
          photographs of beady-eyed kids magnet-fastened to the fridge, the
          grainy scrape of stray kitty litter under your feet as you move around
          in the laundry room. You can't help yourself, even when you're trying
          to be professional. You are a professional so you do your work, but
          how can you help but see the bras lined up along a shower curtain rod
          like birds on a wire? Once you saw a vibrator hiding in the sheets of
          an unmade bed. The dog was in there too, a little ball of a thing,
          looking at you like, so what? These are people you've known your whole
          life, who played with you on rickety jungle gyms, who got drunk with
          you in parked cars lined up at quarry's edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are always so full of worry and concern and annoyance and a kind
          of mild, bored surprise at seeing your face smiling from the doorway.
          Come in, they tell you.

        <h4>
          <strong>The Arm of the Lord</strong> in
          <strong>The Kenyon Review</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          I was seven years old, maybe eight, and my father and I were staying
          at a strange house again. How long had we been driving? The days spun
          loose behind us, and I didn't bother counting. I remember his right
          hand on the wheel, his voice speaking in fragments. I'd wake up in a
          new city, a new state. He would smile and say, “Not much longer.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This new house—I don't remember exactly where—smelled of motor oil.
          The carpet on the porch ran black with it, a mark as big as a body. I
          remember that much. And the movie on the rabbit-eared TV. A man talked
          about how they were coming, they would be there soon. Back then
          something would appear on the TV, and then it would vanish and you'd
          never see it again. You were left with a few afterimages, like the
          milky residue of a dream, a longing to find the thing and make sense
          of it. So you paid attention harder when it happened, because you had
          to hold it in your mind. I remember the voice from the box nudging
          everything close to normal. It was almost like we were home on the
          farm, in the smallest bedroom where my mother and I sometimes watched
          game shows on the little black-and-white.
